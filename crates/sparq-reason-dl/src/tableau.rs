//! L3 (part 2) — the terminating ALCH tableau: consistency + class satisfiability.
//!
//! 🤖 SPARQ agent [FABLE-5]. Bead sq-pbz04.4.3 (epic sq-pbz04.4, design record
//! `research/owl2-direct-semantics-scoping.md` §3). A completion-forest tableau with GCI
//! internalisation, the `⊓`/`⊔`/`∃`/`∀`/GCI completion rules matched modulo the role
//! hierarchy, ancestor **subset blocking**, and chronological backtracking over
//! `⊔`-branches. The termination / soundness / completeness argument is reproduced in
//! full below (§3–§5), following Baader & Sattler, *An Overview of Tableau Algorithms
//! for Description Logics*, Studia Logica 69(1):5–40, 2001.
//!
//! # 1. Fragment (exactly ALCH — nothing more)
//!
//! - **Concepts:** named classes, `owl:Thing` (⊤), `owl:Nothing` (⊥), `⊓`, `⊔`, `¬`,
//!   `∃R.C`, `∀R.C` over **named** object properties only.
//! - **TBox:** arbitrary GCIs `C ⊑ D`; `owl:equivalentClass` as two GCIs;
//!   `owl:disjointWith` as `C ⊓ D ⊑ ⊥`; `rdfs:domain` as `∃R.⊤ ⊑ C`; `rdfs:range` as
//!   `⊤ ⊑ ∀R.C`.
//! - **RBox:** `rdfs:subPropertyOf` hierarchies over named object properties; `⊑*` is
//!   the reflexive-transitive closure of the asserted inclusions.
//! - **ABox:** ground class assertions `C(a)` and role assertions `R(a, b)`.
//! - **NOT in the fragment** (and structurally unrepresentable in [`crate::model`]):
//!   inverse roles, transitivity (opt-in-recoverable: §5a, the `dl_transitive` feature)
//!   and all other role characteristics, cardinality /
//!   functionality, nominals (`oneOf`/`hasValue`), datatypes and data properties,
//!   `owl:sameAs` / `owl:differentFrom`, property chains, keys. The L1 extractor
//!   ([`crate::extract()`]) fail-closes on all of them, so
//!   [`consistency_from_extraction`] returns [`UnknownReason::OutOfFragment`] **before
//!   the tableau starts** — an out-of-fragment input never receives a verdict.
//!
//! # 2. The procedure
//!
//! **Preprocessing.** Every TBox axiom is desugared to GCIs as above and each GCI
//! `Cᵢ ⊑ Dᵢ` is **internalised** into the universal constraint
//! `Uᵢ = nnf(¬Cᵢ) ⊔ nnf(Dᵢ)` (negation normal form via [`crate::nnf`]; NNF is an
//! equivalence-preserving rewrite). ABox class assertions are NNF'd and seeded into the
//! labels of their individuals' **root nodes**; ABox role assertions become edges
//! between roots. When there is no ABox individual, a single fresh unconstrained root is
//! created: the OWL 2 Direct Semantics interprets over **non-empty** domains, so
//! TBox-only inconsistencies such as `⊤ ⊑ ⊥` are still caught. For class
//! satisfiability of `C` an extra fresh root labelled `{nnf(C)}` is added (`C` is
//! satisfiable w.r.t. `O` iff `O ∪ {C(a_fresh)}` is consistent, `a_fresh` occurring
//! nowhere else). Every concept that can ever appear in a label is interned into a
//! fixed table up front; expansion manipulates only table indices and **cannot mint a
//! new concept** (debug-asserted against `nnf::subexpression_closure`).
//!
//! **Completion rules** (on the current label `L(x)`; `S ⊑* R` written for the role
//! closure):
//!
//! - **GCI-rule:** if `Uᵢ ∉ L(x)` for some internalised constraint: add `Uᵢ` to `L(x)`.
//! - **⊓-rule:** if `(C₁ ⊓ … ⊓ Cₙ) ∈ L(x)` and some `Cᵢ ∉ L(x)`: add every `Cᵢ`.
//! - **∀-rule:** if `∀R.C ∈ L(x)`, there is an edge `x –S→ y` with `S ⊑* R`, and
//!   `C ∉ L(y)`: add `C` to `L(y)`.
//! - **⊔-rule:** if `(C₁ ⊔ … ⊔ Cₙ) ∈ L(x)` and no `Cᵢ ∈ L(x)`: **choose** some `Cᵢ`
//!   and add it (the only nondeterministic rule; explored by chronological
//!   backtracking, disjuncts left to right).
//! - **∃-rule:** if `∃R.C ∈ L(x)`, `x` is **not blocked** (below), and there is no edge
//!   `x –S→ y` with `S ⊑* R` and `C ∈ L(y)`: create a fresh tree successor `y` of `x`
//!   with edge label `R` and `L(y) = {C}`.
//!
//! A **clash** is `⊥ ∈ L(x)` or `{A, ¬A} ⊆ L(x)` for a named class `A` (in NNF these
//! are the only inconsistent local patterns); a clash anywhere abandons the branch. A
//! branch with no applicable rule is **quiescent** and yields `Satisfiable`; when every
//! branch clashes the input is `Unsatisfiable`.
//!
//! **Blocking (ancestor subset blocking).** A node `y` is *blocked* iff some non-root
//! node `v` on the tree path from `y`'s root down to `y` (including `y` itself) has an
//! ancestor `x` in that path with `L(v) ⊆ L(x)`. This explicit form is equivalent to
//! the standard recursive definition — "`v` is *directly blocked* iff no strict
//! ancestor of `v` is directly blocked and `L(v) ⊆ L(x)` for some ancestor `x`; `y` is
//! blocked iff `y` or a strict ancestor of `y` is directly blocked" — because the
//! *topmost* `v` with the subset property is exactly the directly blocked one. Roots
//! (ABox individuals, the fresh roots) are never blocked, but a root **may serve as a
//! blocker**: soundness of that is argued in §5 (it needs no inverse roles). Blocking
//! gates **only** the ∃-rule and is re-evaluated on the *current* labels at every
//! prospective application — never cached. All other rules keep firing on and into
//! blocked nodes; in particular the ∀-rule keeps propagating into a blocked node, so
//! the subset test is never made against a stale label (labels grow monotonically: a
//! blocked node can become unblocked when its label outgrows its blocker's, and the
//! implementation must — and does — notice).
//!
//! # 3. Termination (following Baader & Sattler 2001, the ALC-with-GCIs configuration;
//! role hierarchies change nothing because blocking is label-based only)
//!
//! 1. **Finite closure.** Let `sub(O)` be the subexpression closure
//!    ([`crate::nnf::subexpression_closure`]) of the preprocessed input: all `Uᵢ`, the
//!    NNF of every ABox-asserted concept, and (for class satisfiability) `nnf(C)`.
//!    `sub(O)` is finite and linear in the input size (NNF does not duplicate
//!    subterms). Every label is always a subset of `sub(O)`: the seeds are members, and
//!    each rule adds only ⊓/⊔-members or ∃/∀-fillers of concepts already in some label
//!    (all subexpressions), or a `Uᵢ` (a seed). The implementation enforces this
//!    structurally — the closure is interned before expansion and the rules move only
//!    indices. Hence at most `2^|sub(O)|` distinct labels exist.
//! 2. **Monotone rules.** Within one branch, rules only add concepts to labels or add
//!    nodes and edges; nothing is ever removed (backtracking abandons a branch and
//!    resumes from a snapshot of an earlier choice point — it never shrinks a label
//!    within a branch). Each rule instance's applicability is extinguished by the very
//!    addition it makes, so on a fixed node set only finitely many applications occur.
//! 3. **Depth bound — where blocking is load-bearing.** Only the ∃-rule lengthens a
//!    tree path, and it is gated on the focus node being unblocked. Suppose it is about
//!    to fire on a node `y` whose tree path from its root contains more than
//!    `2^|sub(O)|` non-root nodes. By (1) and pigeonhole, two nodes on that path carry
//!    *equal* labels at this instant; the lower one, `v`, then satisfies `L(v) ⊆ L(x)`
//!    for its ancestor `x` — so `y` is blocked by the §2 definition (`v` lies on `y`'s
//!    path), and the rule does not fire: contradiction. Subset blocking can only fire
//!    *earlier* than this equality bound. Every tree path therefore stays at most
//!    `2^|sub(O)| + 1` nodes deep.
//! 4. **Node bound.** A node gains tree successors only via the ∃-rule, at most once
//!    per `∃R.C ∈ sub(O)`: after firing, the fresh `R`-successor containing `C`
//!    falsifies the rule's precondition forever (labels and edges only grow). So
//!    out-degree is bounded by `|sub(O)|` plus, at roots, the asserted ABox edges.
//!    Finitely many roots + bounded depth (3) + bounded out-degree ⇒ each branch's
//!    forest is finite; with (2), each branch performs finitely many rule applications.
//!    The ⊔-search tree is finitely branching (disjunction width) with depth bounded by
//!    the per-branch application count, so chronological backtracking visits finitely
//!    many branches. The procedure terminates on **every** input — independently of the
//!    budgets, which bound *work*, not termination. ∎
//!
//! # 4. Soundness (an `Unsatisfiable` verdict is true)
//!
//! Call a forest *satisfiable* when there is a model `I` of the ontology and a map `π`
//! from **all** forest nodes (blocked or not) into `Δ^I` with `π(n) ∈ C^I` for every
//! `C ∈ L(n)` and `(π(n), π(m)) ∈ S^I` for every edge `n –S→ m`. The initial forest is
//! satisfiable iff the input is: ABox roots carry exactly the (NNF'd,
//! equivalence-preserved) asserted facts; the fresh unconstrained root is always
//! satisfiable because Direct-Semantics domains are non-empty; the class-satisfiability
//! root encodes `O ∪ {C(a_fresh)}` as in §2. Every deterministic rule preserves forest
//! satisfiability: GCI- and ⊓-additions are entailed at `π(x)` (`I ⊨ Cᵢ ⊑ Dᵢ` makes
//! `Uᵢ` hold everywhere); a ∀-addition holds at `π(y)` because
//! `(π(x), π(y)) ∈ S^I ⊆ R^I` (`I` satisfies the role inclusions, hence their
//! composition `⊑*`); the ∃-rule extends `π` by mapping the fresh node to a witness of
//! `π(x) ∈ (∃R.C)^I`. For the ⊔-rule, some disjunct holds at `π(x)`, so **at least one
//! branch** preserves satisfiability. Because `π` covers blocked nodes too (§2: rules
//! keep firing there, and each addition is entailed at the node's `π`-image), a
//! satisfiable forest can never exhibit a clash *anywhere* — so abandoning a branch on
//! any clash is safe. `Unsatisfiable` is returned only when the exhaustive,
//! terminating (§3) search has clashed on every branch; by preservation the initial
//! forest — hence the input — has no model. ∎
//!
//! # 5. Completeness (a `Satisfiable` verdict is true)
//!
//! `Satisfiable` is returned only from a quiescent, clash-free forest `F`. Build a
//! finite interpretation `I`: for a directly blocked node `m`, let `σ(m)` be its
//! blocker (nearest ancestor `x` with `L(m) ⊆ L(x)` on the final labels); for unblocked
//! `m`, `σ(m) = m`. Take `Δ` = the unblocked nodes of `F` (non-empty: roots are never
//! blocked and at least one root always exists); `A^I = {n ∈ Δ : A ∈ L(n)}`; each ABox
//! individual denotes its root; for every edge `n –S→ m` with `n ∈ Δ`, put
//! `(n, σ(m))` into `T^I` for every `T` with `S ⊑* T`. (This is total: if `n` is
//! unblocked, every strict ancestor of `m` is unblocked, so a blocked `m` is *directly*
//! blocked and its blocker lies on `n`'s path — unblocked, hence in `Δ`.) Then for
//! every `n ∈ Δ` and `D ∈ L(n)`: `n ∈ D^I`, by induction on `D`:
//!
//! - `⊤` trivially; `⊥ ∉ L(n)` and, for literals, `{A, ¬A} ⊄ L(n)` (clash-freeness)
//!   give `A`/`¬A` via the definition of `A^I`.
//! - `⊓`/`⊔`: `n` is unblocked and quiescent, so the conjuncts / a disjunct are in
//!   `L(n)`; induction.
//! - `∃R.C ∈ L(n)`: `n` is unblocked, so quiescence means some edge `n –S→ m` with
//!   `S ⊑* R` and `C ∈ L(m)` exists. Then `(n, σ(m)) ∈ R^I` and
//!   `C ∈ L(m) ⊆ L(σ(m))` — equality when `m` is unblocked, the *subset-blocking
//!   condition on the final labels* otherwise (this is why blocking is re-evaluated
//!   dynamically and never cached). Induction gives `σ(m) ∈ C^I`.
//! - `∀R.C ∈ L(n)`: every `R^I`-edge out of `n` is `(n, σ(m))` for an `F`-edge
//!   `n –S→ m` with `S ⊑* R`; quiescence of the ∀-rule (which fires into `m` whether or
//!   not `m` is blocked) put `C ∈ L(m) ⊆ L(σ(m))`; induction. **This is the step that
//!   needs the absence of inverse roles — see below.**
//!
//! The GCI-rule keeps every `Uᵢ` in every label, so by the above every element of `Δ`
//! satisfies every internalised GCI; role inclusions hold by the `⊑*`-closure in the
//! edge construction; ABox assertions hold at the (never redirected) roots. So
//! `I ⊨ O`, and for class satisfiability the fresh root witnesses `C^I ≠ ∅`. ∎
//!
//! ## Why SUBSET blocking suffices here — and would NOT with inverse roles
//!
//! (The load-bearing note; design record §3/§5. Cf. Baader & Sattler 2001 §5;
//! Horrocks & Sattler, *A Description Logic with Transitive and Inverse Roles and Role
//! Hierarchies*, J. Logic & Computation 9(3), 1999.)
//!
//! The construction above replaces a directly blocked node `m` by its blocker
//! `x = σ(m)`: it redirects `m`'s single incoming tree edge `n –S→ m` to `n –S→ x`.
//! Every obligation this redirect must honour flows **downward along the edge**: `n`'s
//! `∀`-constraints demand certain concepts at the edge target, and `L(m) ⊆ L(x)`
//! delivers exactly them, because the ∀-rule had already pushed each such concept into
//! `L(m)`. In ALCH **no construct propagates a constraint upward against edge
//! direction**: with only named roles, giving `x` a new incoming edge imposes nothing
//! on `x`, and `x`'s label imposes nothing on its new predecessor `n`. So the only
//! guarantee a blocker must give is "at least the blocked node's concepts" — a subset
//! test. This also covers a root acting as blocker: the redirect burdens it with
//! nothing.
//!
//! With inverse roles this breaks: `∀R⁻.E ∈ L(x)` imposes `E` on every
//! `R`-**predecessor** of `x`. In `F` that obligation was discharged against `x`'s own
//! predecessor, but the redirect gives `x` a *new* predecessor `n` that never saw it —
//! and `L(m) ⊆ L(x)` is the wrong direction to transfer `x`'s inverse obligations to
//! `m`'s context (nothing forces `∀R⁻.E ∈ L(m)`, let alone `E ∈ L(n)`). A `Satisfiable`
//! verdict would then no longer be true: subset blocking must be strengthened to at
//! least **equality** blocking for ALCI, and to pairwise/dynamic blocking once number
//! restrictions are added (Horrocks & Sattler 1999). That is exactly why inverse roles
//! are a deferred, separately-argued extension in the design record's deferral ledger
//! (§5), and why [`crate::model::ObjectPropertyExpression`] has no inverse variant for
//! this module to silently mis-handle. (Transitive roles, by contrast, are the
//! first-in-line extension: absent inverses they need a `∀₊`-propagation rule but no
//! blocking change — Horrocks & Sattler 1999; implemented behind the OPT-IN
//! `dl_transitive` feature and argued in full in §5a below, [GPT-5.6] sq-zfwzq.)
//!
//! # 5a. Transitive roles — the opt-in `dl_transitive` extension ([GPT-5.6] sq-zfwzq)
//!
//! Under the OPT-IN `dl_transitive` cargo feature (OFF by default; with it off this module
//! compiles to exactly the ALCH tableau above) the fragment grows by TRANSITIVE role
//! declarations `Trans(T)` (`owl:TransitiveProperty`, recorded by L1 as the feature-gated
//! `Axiom::TransitiveObjectProperty` variant — a code span, not a link, because the variant
//! is compiled out by default): ALCH + role hierarchies + transitivity — Horrocks &
//! Sattler's *S with role hierarchies* (SH without inverses), still **no** inverses, number
//! restrictions, or nominals (those stay fail-closed §5-ledger deferrals in BOTH feature
//! states). ONE completion rule is added (Horrocks & Sattler 1999; Baader & Sattler 2001
//! §5):
//!
//! - **∀₊-rule:** if `∀R.C ∈ L(x)`, there is an edge `x –S→ y`, and some **transitive**
//!   role `T` has `S ⊑* T` and `T ⊑* R`, and `∀T.C ∉ L(y)`: add `∀T.C` to `L(y)`.
//!
//! Like the ∀-rule it keeps firing into blocked nodes (the subset test must never see a
//! stale label). **Blocking is UNCHANGED** — ancestor subset blocking, gating only the
//! ∃-rule. That is the load-bearing Horrocks–Sattler claim, and it is *argued* below (the
//! soundness/completeness/termination deltas), not asserted.
//!
//! ## Termination (§3 extended)
//!
//! Extend the interned universe to the ∀₊-closure
//! `sub⁺(O) = sub(O) ∪ { ∀T.C : ∀R.C ∈ sub⁺(O), Trans(T), T ⊑* R }`. The fixpoint is
//! finite: every generated concept is `∀T.C` for a transitive input role `T` and the filler
//! `C` of a `∀`-member of `sub(O)`, so `|sub⁺(O)| ≤ |sub(O)| · (1 + |{T : Trans(T)}|)`;
//! chained generation closes after one round because `T' ⊑* T` and `T ⊑* R` give
//! `T' ⊑* R` (`⊑*` is transitive), so the `∀T'.C` a generated `∀T.C` would demand was
//! already generated from the original `∀R.C`. `preprocess` pre-interns `sub⁺(O)` (the
//! §3-step-1 debug assertion is extended by the same seeds) and expansion still moves only
//! table indices — no rule can mint a concept outside `sub⁺(O)`. The ∀₊-rule is monotone
//! and self-extinguishing exactly like the ∀-rule, so §3 steps 2–4 go through verbatim with
//! `sub(O)` replaced by the finite `sub⁺(O)`: every tree path stays at most
//! `2^|sub⁺(O)| + 1` nodes deep and the search terminates on **every** input. ∎
//!
//! ## Soundness (§4 extended)
//!
//! With `I`, `π` as in §4, every model of a transitive input interprets `T^I` transitively.
//! Suppose the ∀₊-rule fires: `∀R.C ∈ L(x)`, edge `x –S→ y`, `Trans(T)`, `S ⊑* T ⊑* R`.
//! For any `T`-successor `z` of `π(y)`: `(π(x), π(y)) ∈ S^I ⊆ T^I` and `(π(y), z) ∈ T^I`,
//! so transitivity gives `(π(x), z) ∈ T^I ⊆ R^I`, hence `z ∈ C^I` from
//! `π(x) ∈ (∀R.C)^I`. So `π(y) ∈ (∀T.C)^I`: the addition is entailed at `π(y)` and forest
//! satisfiability is preserved; the rest of §4 is unchanged. ∎
//!
//! ## Completeness (§5 extended)
//!
//! The §5 construction must now interpret transitive roles transitively. From a quiescent,
//! clash-free forest define per role `R` the edge set
//! `E(R) = { (n, σ(m)) : n ∈ Δ, F-edge n –S→ m, S ⊑* R }` (exactly the §5 edges) and
//! interpret `R^I = E(R) ∪ ⋃ { E(T)⁺ : Trans(T), T ⊑* R }` (`⁺` = transitive closure).
//! Then (a) **role inclusions hold**: `R ⊑* Q` gives `E(R) ⊆ E(Q)` and every transitive
//! `T ⊑* R` also has `T ⊑* Q`, so `R^I ⊆ Q^I`; (b) **every transitive `T` is transitive
//! in `I`**: each `T' ⊑* T` gives `E(T') ⊆ E(T)`, hence `E(T')⁺ ⊆ E(T)⁺`, so
//! `T^I = E(T)⁺` — a transitive closure. The §5 induction changes in exactly one case,
//! `∀R.C ∈ L(n)` with `(n, z) ∈ R^I`:
//!
//! - `(n, z) ∈ E(R)`: as in §5 — quiescence of the ∀-rule put `C ∈ L(m) ⊆ L(σ(m))`.
//! - `(n, z) ∈ E(T)⁺`, `Trans(T)`, `T ⊑* R`: there is an `E(T)`-path
//!   `n = x₀ → x₁ → … → x_k = z` (`k ≥ 1`), each step `(xᵢ, xᵢ₊₁) = (xᵢ, σ(mᵢ))` for an
//!   `F`-edge `xᵢ –Sᵢ→ mᵢ` with `Sᵢ ⊑* T` and `xᵢ ∈ Δ`. If `k = 1`, the plain ∀-rule at
//!   `x₀ = n` (with `S₀ ⊑* T ⊑* R`) put `C ∈ L(m₀) ⊆ L(σ(m₀)) = L(z)`. Otherwise the
//!   ∀₊-rule at `n` (`S₀ ⊑* T`, `Trans(T)`, `T ⊑* R`) put `∀T.C ∈ L(m₀) ⊆ L(x₁)`, and
//!   inductively along the path: from `∀T.C ∈ L(xᵢ)` (`1 ≤ i < k`), the ∀₊-rule with
//!   `Sᵢ ⊑* T`, `Trans(T)`, `T ⊑* T` re-propagates `∀T.C ∈ L(mᵢ) ⊆ L(xᵢ₊₁)`, and at the
//!   final step the plain ∀-rule on `∀T.C ∈ L(x_{k−1})` puts
//!   `C ∈ L(m_{k−1}) ⊆ L(σ(m_{k−1})) = L(z)`. Induction on `C` finishes as in §5.
//!
//! Every obligation above transfers **downward** along an edge via `L(m) ⊆ L(σ(m))` — the
//! subset-blocking condition on the final labels — including the NEW `∀T.C` obligations the
//! ∀₊-rule pushed into every blocked node (it fires into blocked nodes, and subset blocking
//! is re-evaluated on current labels). Nothing propagates upward against edge direction, so
//! subset blocking remains sufficient — exactly the "absent inverses" proviso of Horrocks &
//! Sattler 1999; with inverses this section's argument would fail at the same point §5's
//! does. ∎
//!
//! # 6. Budgets and determinism
//!
//! Budgets are **deterministic counts only** ([`Budget`]): `max_nodes` bounds the total
//! number of forest nodes ever created over the whole search (roots included; never
//! decremented on backtracking), `max_rule_applications` bounds completion-rule
//! applications (including each ⊔-disjunct trial and re-applications after
//! backtracking). Exhaustion returns [`UnknownReason::ResourceBudget`] — **never a
//! verdict**. Wall-clock budgets are banned by design (design record §3: conformance
//! floors must be reproducible). All scan orders are fixed (nodes and edges in creation
//! order, label concepts in interning order, universal constraints in axiom order,
//! disjuncts left to right), so for a given [`crate::model::Ontology`] value and
//! [`Budget`] the outcome — including *which* budget trips — is identical on every run.
//!
//! # 7. Honest scope
//!
//! This module decides consistency / class satisfiability **only for the exact ALCH
//! fragment of §1** — extended by transitive roles per §5a when (and only when) the
//! opt-in `dl_transitive` feature is enabled — as delivered by the L1 structural model.
//! It is **not** an OWL 2 DL
//! reasoner, and no claim of soundness or completeness is made beyond the argued
//! fragment. Anything the L1 extractor could not map — genuinely out-of-fragment
//! constructs *or* malformed encodings — yields `Unknown(OutOfFragment)`, fail-closed,
//! before any reasoning. Within the fragment, the unique-name assumption is neither
//! made nor needed: no ALCH construct can force two individuals to be equal or
//! distinct, and the §5 construction simply keeps roots distinct. Concept
//! satisfiability w.r.t. general TBoxes in ALC is EXPTIME-complete (Schild's PDL
//! correspondence; *The Description Logic Handbook*, 2nd ed., ch. 2–3), and role
//! hierarchies do not change this; this implementation is a straightforward blocking
//! tableau and is **not** claimed worst-case optimal — the budgets exist to bound its
//! work deterministically.
