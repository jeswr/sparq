//! The per-source **privacy descriptor** — the new seam input (design record §4.2).
//!
//! [`sparq_fedplan::SourceDescriptor`] describes a source's *content* (predicates, classes,
//! char-sets, authorities). This module adds the orthogonal **privacy** declaration the
//! later routing pass needs: which of a source's predicates it is willing to disclose in the
//! clear, the opaque attestation-key id its graph is signed under, and a reserved
//! participation/authorisation field (the deferred B7 hook).
//!
//! # Default-DENY (the load-bearing posture)
//!
//! The whole point of the seam is to *minimise* what leaves a source in the clear, so the
//! safe default is to treat **every** predicate as PRIVATE — disclosable only when the source
//! has explicitly opted it in. [`SourcePrivacyDescriptor::default`] therefore discloses
//! NOTHING, and [`SourcePrivacyDescriptor::may_disclose`] returns `false` for any predicate
//! that was not explicitly marked [`Disclosability::Public`]. A planner cannot widen this: a
//! later pass *reads* the descriptor, but the source re-enforces it fail-closed (the design
//! record's constraint C-B), so an over-disclosing plan is rejected, not honoured.
//!
//! This module performs NO MPC and runs NO privacy-bearing computation — it is a typed policy
//! declaration. It makes no soundness/privacy claim; the privacy-bearing phases that consume
//! it are deferred and audit-gated (sq-9hrn / sq-qhy4). See the crate `README.md`.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-2q1x.
