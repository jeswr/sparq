//! **Phase 3** — the disclosed/hidden routing pass (design record §4.3 pass 2 / §8 Phase 3;
//! bead sq-i1wh2, epics sq-pwr / sq-0jsc).
//!
//! This module turns the [`route_operators`] stub from a `SeamError::Deferred` into a real,
//! policy-parameterised partition: given the Phase-2 selected sources, the per-source privacy
//! descriptors, and the query's operators, it classifies each operator as **disclosed** (runs
//! in the clear, outside the cryptographic core) or **hidden** (must route through the MPC
//! path) and emits the [`sparq_mpc::pipeline::OperatorRouting`] vector the pipeline already
//! consumes — the structure `sparq-mpc::pipeline` today receives hand-written.
//!
//! # The decision rule (design record §4.3 pass 2 — convention #4, applied greedily)
//!
//! Per operator, route **`Disclosed`** when *every* operand is disclosable in the clear, and
//! **`Hidden(class)`** otherwise — default-deny: an operator whose disclosability cannot be
//! affirmatively established is hidden. An operand is disclosable when:
//!
//! * it is a **global IRI** ([`Operand::GlobalIri`]) — public by convention #6 — **and** the
//!   policy is [`RoutingPolicy::Default`] (the strict policy can still hide a global IRI when a
//!   contributing source marks the predicate it binds private), or
//! * it is a **predicate** ([`Operand::Predicate`]) that **every** contributing source has
//!   *explicitly* marked [`crate::Disclosability::Public`] via
//!   [`SourcePrivacyDescriptor::may_disclose`]. A predicate that *any* contributing source
//!   leaves private (the default) is **not** disclosable — the most-private source wins, so a
//!   single private holder forces the whole operator into the hidden route.
//!
//! [`RoutingPolicy::Strict`] honours the design record's §5 "hide even a public term" knob: a
//! source may mark a predicate that *would* be public-by-convention as private, and the strict
//! policy then routes the operator hidden even though a global-IRI operand would otherwise
//! disclose. This is the documented cost-vs-privacy knob (§5); the default policy is the cheap,
//! demo-matching route.
//!
//! When an operator is routed `Hidden`, the [`sparq_mpc::backend::OperatorClass`] it carries is
//! the caller-supplied class of the operator ([`QueryOperator::class`]) — a linear aggregate, an
//! equality/hidden-value join, or a comparison — so the pipeline reads off the exact per-operator
//! security tier via [`sparq_mpc::backend::MpcBackend::operator_security`]. This pass does **not**
//! choose the class; it chooses the *route*, and propagates the class the operator already has.
//!
//! # Honesty / threat model — what this pass IS and what it LEAKS (documented limitation)
//!
//! This is **routing plumbing — a partition over typed operators, not a cryptographic
//! guarantee.** It performs **NO** MPC, runs **NO** secret-sharing, opens nothing, and verifies
//! nothing. It makes **NO** soundness/privacy/security claim. The MPC estate (`sparq-mpc`) is
//! research-grade, **honest-majority semi-honest only**, and is **NOT** externally audited — the
//! accredited-cryptographer sign-off (sq-qhy4) and the coZK re-audit (sq-9hrn) are pending. This
//! pass does not change that posture by one inch.
//!
//! **What the routing decision itself reveals (a documented leakage assumption, not a bound).**
//! The output `Vec<OperatorRouting>` *is* metadata about the query: it discloses the **operator
//! structure** (how many operators, of which class, in which order) and **which operators were
//! chosen disclosed vs hidden** — i.e. the shape of the query and the disclose/hide partition
//! itself. It does **not** reveal operand *values* or result *cardinalities* (those live in the
//! later evaluation, not in this typed plan). The disclose decision is the design record's
//! constraint C-B (§2.2): the planner here only *proposes* the partition; a later phase (Phase 4)
//! has each source **re-enforce** its own policy fail-closed and the verifier ratify the declared
//! leakage envelope, so a lying planner that over-discloses is rejected, not honoured. This pass
//! does **not** perform that ratification — it computes the proposed partition only. See the
//! crate `README.md` and `research/mpc-untrusted-planner-routing-design.md` §2.2 / §4.4 / §6.
