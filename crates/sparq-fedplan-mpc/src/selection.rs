//! **Phase 2** — the privacy/authorisation-aware source-selection adapter (design record
//! §4.3 pass 1 / §8 Phase 2; bead sq-fix4, epics sq-pwr / sq-0jsc).
//!
//! This module turns the [`select_private_sources`] stub from a
//! `SeamError::Deferred` into a real adapter: it runs [`sparq_fedplan::select_sources`] over the
//! BGP + source descriptors, then **prunes** any source that has declared it will not participate
//! for this query (the per-source [`SourcePrivacyDescriptor`]'s reserved authorisation field),
//! and surfaces the retained candidate set plus an audit trail of what was pruned and why.
//!
//! # What this phase DOES and does NOT prune (the load-bearing scope)
//!
//! This is **plumbing — source-selection routing, not a cryptographic guarantee.** It performs
//! **NO** MPC, runs **NO** secret-sharing, and reveals nothing it was not already given in the
//! clear (the descriptors are the caller's own inputs). The one and only pruning rule here is
//! **participation/authorisation**:
//!
//! * A source whose [`SourcePrivacyDescriptor::participates`] is `Some(false)` is dropped from
//!   every pattern's candidate list — it has declared it will not answer for this query.
//! * A source with `participates == Some(true)`, with `participates == None` (no authorisation
//!   policy declared at this tier — the reserved B7 hook), or with **no privacy descriptor at
//!   all**, is **kept**. Dropping a source we have no *non*-participation evidence for would
//!   silently lose answers — exactly the recall-unsafe behaviour the upstream
//!   [`select_sources`] is careful to avoid.
//!
//! **A private predicate does NOT cause a source to be pruned here.** Whether a source's
//! *content* must be disclosed in the clear or routed through MPC is the **disclosed/hidden
//! routing decision (Phase 3)**, not source selection. A source that holds a private predicate
//! the query needs is still a *candidate* — it just gets routed `Hidden` later. Pruning it at
//! selection time would drop a source that genuinely contributes to the answer, i.e. produce a
//! **wrong** result. So Phase 2 reads [`SourcePrivacyDescriptor::may_disclose`] for **no** prune
//! decision; that read is Phase 3's job.
//!
//! # Honesty / threat model (no claim beyond what is established)
//!
//! The MPC estate (`sparq-mpc`) is research-grade, **honest-majority semi-honest only**, and is
//! **not** externally audited — the accredited-cryptographer sign-off (sq-qhy4) and the coZK
//! re-audit (sq-9hrn) are pending. This adapter does **not** change that posture by one inch and
//! makes **no** soundness/privacy/security claim. Its documented assumption is the design
//! record's constraint C-B (§2.2): the privacy descriptor is the **source's own declaration**;
//! this adapter merely *reads* it to route, and a later phase has each source *re-enforce* it
//! fail-closed, so a lying planner cannot widen disclosure. The adapter itself enforces nothing
//! cryptographic — see the crate `README.md` and the design record.
//!
