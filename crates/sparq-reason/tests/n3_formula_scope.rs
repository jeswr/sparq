//! N3 formula-scope builtins — `log:includes` / `notIncludes` / `supports` / `conclusion` /
//! `conjunction` / `parsedAsN3`, and the resolver-gated `log:semantics` / `log:content`.
//!
//! 🤖 SPARQ agent — sq-qcnn test-quality slice [OPUS-4.8].
//!
//! These exercise the formula-containment + scope-closure machinery (the deepest dark region of
//! the N3 engine). Each case is hand-derived from cwm/EYE log: builtin semantics: a forward rule
//! whose premise is a formula-scope check fires iff the scope relation holds. We assert the EXACT
//! entailed triple is present when the relation holds and ABSENT when it must not — and, for the
//! binding modes, that the bound value is correct.
