//! [Kern] End-to-end quoted-triple (RDF 1.2 reifier) RL inference — the integration
//! suite for the `quoted-triples` feature (a Cargo `required-features` target;
//! kern/quoted-triple-infer, first increment). Fixtures are Turtle 1.2 strings run
//! through the REAL loader (`Graph::parse_to_triples` — reifiedTriple `<< … >>`,
//! `~ :r` reifiers, `{| … |}` annotation blocks, `<<( … )>>` triple terms), so the
//! rules are exercised against exactly the reifier representation sparq-core mints.
//! Expected answers are asserted positively AND negatively: the opacity
//! non-entailments (a quotation never asserts its quoted triple) and the
//! finite-Herbrand-base pins (no unguarded or nested-quotation term is ever minted)
//! matter as much as the derivations. See src/reify.rs for the rule table and the
//! termination argument.
