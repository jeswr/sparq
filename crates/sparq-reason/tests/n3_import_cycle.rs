//! N3 `log:semantics` recursive-import CYCLE-SAFETY (bead sq-0fj4p, survey §A10).
//!
//! 🤖 SPARQ agent — sq-0fj4p N3 import-cycle detection [OPUS-4.8].
//!
//! N3 is Turing-complete: a `log:semantics` document whose own closure re-imports a document
//! active up the resolution stack — directly (A->A), indirectly (A->B->A), or via a re-used
//! node in a diamond — drives the `formula_closure` -> nested-closure recursion forever under
//! a LIVE resolver. Without the guard this aborts the process with a stack overflow (a
//! denial-of-service on any production caller that wires a network/filesystem resolver). The
//! engine now breaks such a cyclic re-import (returns the in-progress formula unclosed,
//! cwm-style: a document already being loaded is not re-loaded), so reasoning always
//! TERMINATES. Valid acyclic imports — including a diamond that legitimately re-uses a shared
//! document across SIBLING branches — are unaffected.
//!
//! Every cyclic case runs on a watchdog thread: a regression (the guard removed) would hang or
//! crash the whole suite, so the watchdog turns non-termination into an explicit, bounded
//! FAILURE rather than a hang. Documents use the `doc:`/`ex:` IRI spaces; the resolver maps a
//! `doc:` IRI to that document's N3 text (the production analogue of a deref).
