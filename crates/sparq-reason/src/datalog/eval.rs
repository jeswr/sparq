//! [FABLE-5] sq-6tykl.3 / sq-8sve7 — the **semi-naive per-stratum evaluator** (Phase 2).
//!
//! Strata run in ascending order; within a stratum, rules iterate to fixpoint with
//! **semi-naive delta restriction** — the exact round discipline
//! [`crate::n3::compiled`]'s eval loop implements:
//!
//! * **round 0**: every fact in the store (inputs + lower-strata derivations) is the
//!   delta, so the first round is equivalent to a full run;
//! * **each later round**: a monotonic rule re-runs once per positive-atom index `k`
//!   with atom `k` restricted to the previous round's newly-derived delta (all other
//!   atoms read the full store; duplicates de-duplicate at store insertion). Any new
//!   derivation must use at least one delta fact in some positive position, so the
//!   union over `k` is complete; instantiations entirely inside the older store were
//!   produced in an earlier round.
//! * rules with **no positive atoms** draw only on relations that are constant within
//!   the stratum (aggregate tables, `NOT` over completed lower strata), so they fire
//!   in round 0 only — the n3 `join_steps.is_empty()` discipline;
//! * rules carrying **`NOT`** keep the full re-run every round ([`needs_full`], the n3
//!   discipline for scoped negation). The stratification checker already guarantees
//!   every negated relation is complete before its stratum runs (so delta restriction
//!   would remain sound); the full re-run is deliberate defence-in-depth for this
//!   soundness-sensitive path — it can only cost work, never correctness.
//!
//! Because the checker guarantees every `NOT`-negated / `AGGREGATE`-read predicate is
//! complete before its stratum runs:
//!
//! * `AGGREGATE` tables are computed **once at stratum entry** (their bodies read
//!   strictly-lower strata, which no longer change) and then joined like positive
//!   relations — they are constant within the stratum, so they never gate delta
//!   restriction of the positive atoms;
//! * `NOT` is a per-row absence check against the store's predicate index —
//!   the indexed relation is final, so no retraction can ever be needed.
//!
//! [`EvalStats`] counts rounds and the candidate rows fed into positive-atom join
//! steps — a DETERMINISTIC work measure (no wall-clock; work-box timings are
//! non-canonical). The differential suite asserts the semi-naive closure equals both
//! the forced-full (naive) closure and the independent oracle on every battery input.
//!
//! Positive-atom and aggregate-table joins drive the SHARED
//! [`sparq_substrate::join`] kernels via the same thin layout-adapter pattern as
//! `crate::substrate_join` and `crate::n3::compiled` — build side = binding rows,
//! probe side = candidate rows, combined rows reshaped back into the rule's slot
//! layout.

/// The tie-break is deliberately NOT the dictionary [`Id`]: an id is assigned by

/// ## `NaN` and `-0.0`
///
/// [`Num::cmp_total`] totalises `NaN` BELOW `-INF`, so `MIN` of a group containing a
