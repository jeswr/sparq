//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-yk6or (epic sq-pbz04, THE SUBSTRATE PAYOFF) — drive the SHARED
//! [`sparq_substrate::join`] hash-join kernels for the RDFS single-pass predicate join
//! (rdfs2 / rdfs3 / rdfs7) and — [FABLE-5] sq-pbz04.1.1 — the `rdf:type`/rdfs9
//! subclass-typing join, in place of the hand-rolled [`FxHashMap`](rustc_hash::FxHashMap)
//! adjacency probes in [`crate::rdfs::emit_consequences`].
//!
//! This is the end-to-end proof of the maintainer's "share join logic across the engine AND
//! the reasoners" goal (`research/shared-eval-substrate.md`, Phase 5): the SPARQL engine's
//! `eval_bgp_binary` and this reasoner now drive the *same* `build_table` + `probe_emit`
//! body, each supplying its OWN [`JoinKeys`](sparq_substrate::join::JoinKeys) key projection
//! and its OWN [`Budget`](sparq_substrate::join::Budget), monomorphically — there is no
//! `Box<dyn>` / `&dyn` between the probe loop and either the key projection or the budget
//! poll, so the compiler emits one specialised, inlinable body.
//!
//! # What is shared, and what is NOT
//!
//! The RDFS materialiser's per-assertion rule firing IS a relational join: an asserted triple
//! `(s, p, o)` joins, on its predicate `p`, against the already-saturated schema-closure
//! relations:
//!
//! | rule  | build relation (key = col 0)            | probe key (ABox col) | conclusion      |
//! |-------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
//! | rdfs7 | `sp_closure`: `(p, q)`  (super-property) | predicate (col 1)    | `(s, q, o)`     |
//! | rdfs2 | `dom_full`:   `(p, c)`  (domain class)   | predicate (col 1)    | `(s, type, c)`  |
//! | rdfs3 | `rng_full`:   `(p, c)`  (range class)    | predicate (col 1)    | `(o, type, c)`  |
//! | rdfs9 | `sc_closure`: `(c, d)`  (super-class)    | object (col 2)       | `(s, type, d)`  |
//!
//! So we build ONE substrate hash table per schema relation and probe it with the ABox
//! triples — the rdfs2/3/7 sweep keyed on the triple's predicate column, the rdfs9 sweep
//! keyed on the type-assertion's object column. The kernel does the keyed lookup + per-match
//! row combine; this module reshapes the combined row into the rule's conclusion triple (a
//! fixed column permutation — exactly the thin layout adapter the engine wraps the kernels
//! with).
//!
//! The result is the SAME emitted multiset as [`crate::rdfs::emit_consequences`]'s hand-rolled
//! path — only the join machinery differs. Verified byte-for-byte by
//! [`crate::rdfs::tests`]' equivalence test over both paths.
//!
//! # Disposition of the residual branches ([FABLE-5] sq-pbz04.1.1)
//!
//! sq-yk6or left two `emit_consequences` branches hand-rolled, lumping them together as a
//! "non-uniform combine". The per-branch disposition splits them:
//!
//! - **The `rdf:type` / subclass branch (`rdfs9`): ADOPTED** — [`sweep_type_join`]. On
//!   inspection it is a UNIFORM join after all: build = the saturated subclass closure
//!   `(c, d)` keyed on `c`, probe = the type assertions keyed on their OBJECT column, and
//!   the per-match combine is the FIXED permutation `(s, rdf:type, d)`. The "swapped" key
//!   orientation is only a different probe column index, which [`JoinKeys`]'
//!   `(build_col, probe_col)` pairs express by construction — same kernels, same thin
//!   layout adapter as rdfs2/3/7.
//! - **The `PropExpand` predicate-rewrite branch (inverseOf / Symmetric /
//!   equivalentProperty): RETAINED hand-rolled, permanently.** Its per-match combine is
//!   DATA-DEPENDENT, not a fixed permutation: each matched `(r, swapped)` build row selects
//!   its own output orientation (`swapped` transposes subject/object), and each match then
//!   fans out through a SECOND join — the domain/range typing of the DERIVED predicate `r`,
//!   a column that exists only in the first join's output. The kernel emits exactly one
//!   fixed-layout row per match, so adoption would need swap-partitioned build tables plus a
//!   cascaded second probe that must also suppress the subPropertyOf re-rewrite
//!   (`PropExpand` is already the closure over sp/inverse/symmetric composition — re-probing
//!   `sp_closure` over derived rows would duplicate emissions and break the sweep-level
//!   multiset equivalence). That machinery would rebuild the rule structure AROUND the
//!   kernel to share only its innermost map lookup: all reshape cost, no shared logic. The
//!   oriented emission is pinned by `rdfs::tests` (the inverse/symmetric fixtures and
//!   `prop_expand_inverse_types_through_oriented_domain`), so any future adoption attempt
//!   inherits a red/green harness.
//! - **The OWL-RL semi-naive fixpoint** (`owl.rs`): a delta-driven `Δ ⋈ full ∪ full ⋈ Δ` join
//!   with union-find `sameAs` canonicalisation. Genuinely a different (incremental, mutating)
//!   join shape than the substrate's static `&[Row]` build/probe kernel; its migration onto
//!   the `join::delta` seam is a separate slice (sq-qonbz.2).
