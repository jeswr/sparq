//! [Kern] Quoted-triple (RDF 1.2 reifier) inference for the OWL 2 RL profile —
//! FIRST INCREMENT of the kern/quoted-triple-infer track. Opt-in behind the
//! `quoted-triples` feature; when off this module is cfg'd out entirely (the
//! lean-core posture, like `dtype` / `rif` / `datalog`) and `Profile::OwlRl`
//! closures are byte-identical to before it existed.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! The loaders (sparq-core `ttl`/`nt`) desugar every RDF 1.2 quotation form —
//! `<< :s :p :o >>`, `:s :p :o ~ :r`, `{| … |}` annotation blocks — to ONE shape: a
//! reifier node `R` carrying `R rdf:reifies <<( s p o )>>`, where the triple term
//! `<<( s p o )>>` is interned STRUCTURALLY (one content-addressed dictionary id
//! holding its component ids, [`TermParts::Triple`]) and is a single opaque id
//! everywhere else. This module reasons over exactly that shape.
//!
//! # Rules (both monotone, datalog-style over ids)
//!
//! | rule | premise ⊢ conclusion |
//! |---|---|
//! | reif-dtr (destructure) | `(r rdf:reifies tt)`, `tt = <<( s p o )>>` ⊢ `(r rdf:type rdf:Statement)`, `(r rdf:subject s)`, `(r rdf:predicate p)`, `(r rdf:object o)` |
//! | reif-ctr (construct)   | `(r rdf:subject s)`, `(r rdf:predicate p)`, `(r rdf:object o)`, **`(s p o)` in the closure**, `o` not a triple term ⊢ `(r rdf:reifies <<( s p o )>>)` |
//!
//! These are the RDF 1.2 ↔ classic-reification BRIDGE rules: reif-dtr is the
//! "unstar" projection into the classic vocabulary (`rdf:subject`/`rdf:predicate`/
//! `rdf:object`, whose RDF-Schema reading a reifier still fits), so the ordinary RL
//! rules (domain/range, subPropertyOf, sameAs, …) can reason over the recovered
//! components; reif-ctr is its converse, surfacing classic-reification data as
//! native RDF 1.2 reifiers. They are NOT normative RDF 1.2 entailments — which is
//! exactly why the layer is opt-in rather than silently changing `Profile::OwlRl`
//! results (and the committed inference-conformance ratchet) for data that uses the
//! classic vocabulary innocently.
//!
//! # Finite Herbrand base / termination
//!
//! Forward chaining with a term CONSTRUCTOR is not obviously terminating: an
//! unrestricted construct rule can quote its own conclusions — e.g. under
//! `rdf:reifies rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:object`, minting `tt1` derives
//! `(r rdf:object tt1)`, which licenses minting `<<( r rdf:reifies tt1 )>>`, and so
//! on forever (pinned by `construct_never_quotes_a_triple_term` below). reif-ctr
//! therefore carries two restrictions:
//!
//! 1. **Only EXISTING triples are reified**: the quoted triple `(s p o)` must
//!    already be present in the closure (asserted or derived). reif-ctr never
//!    invents a triple.
//! 2. **No quoting of triple terms**: no component of a CONSTRUCTED triple term may
//!    itself be a triple term (`s`/`p` are excluded by the RDF 1.2 kind guards —
//!    subject IRI/blank, predicate IRI, the same kinds `Dict` enforces for stored
//!    triple terms; `o` is checked explicitly). Destructuring of user-written
//!    nested quotes still works — only the constructor is depth-0.
//!
//! Termination: (i) no rule invents reifier nodes or blank nodes (no existentials);
//! (ii) reif-dtr adds at most 4 triples per `(r, tt)` pair, all over ids that
//! already exist (quotation components are interned at load time even when they
//! occur in no asserted triple); (iii) by restriction 2 every term reif-ctr mints
//! has only LEAF (non-triple-term) components, and neither the RL core nor these
//! rules ever create a new leaf term beyond the fixed rule vocabulary — so the
//! mintable set is bounded by the triples over a FIXED finite leaf universe, and by
//! restriction 1 each mint corresponds to a triple already in the closure. The
//! reachable term universe U is therefore finite, every derivable triple lies in
//! the finite set U³, and all rules are monotone — the alternating
//! reify-step / RL-closure loop in [`crate::materialize_owl_rl`] adds at least one
//! triple per round or stops, reaching the least fixpoint in ≤ |U|³ rounds.
//!
//! Restriction 2 is deliberately decided from TERM STRUCTURE, not from "was this id
//! minted earlier in this run?" — together with the closure-membership form of
//! restriction 1 (membership in the CURRENT set, not a pre-derivation base
//! snapshot) this keeps [`crate::materialize`] IDEMPOTENT as documented: [`step`]
//! is a pure function of `(dict, triples, mode)`, so re-running materialization on
//! its own fixpoint derives nothing new. (A base-snapshot guard would NOT be
//! idempotent: a triple derived by, say, rdfs7 on the first call is "base" on the
//! second call and would suddenly become quotable.)
//!
//! # Opacity (coordinated with the sibling opacity-semantics PR; no dependency)
//!
//! * NO rule derives `(s p o)` from `(r rdf:reifies <<( s p o )>>)` — quotation
//!   never asserts. Pinned by the leak tests here and in tests/owl_reify.rs.
//! * A triple term is ONE opaque id to every RL rule AND to the `owl:sameAs`
//!   union-find (entity rewriting canonicalizes triple POSITIONS, never the
//!   component ids stored INSIDE a triple term) — no rule ever REWRITES a
//!   quotation. Note the boundary precisely, though: the DESTRUCTURED classic
//!   vocabulary is transparent by design, so the bridge COMPOSITION
//!   (reif-dtr, then eq-rep on `rdf:subject` values, then reif-ctr) can derive
//!   `r rdf:reifies <<( x p o )>>` from `r rdf:reifies <<( s p o )>>` +
//!   `x sameAs s` — but ONLY when the variant triple `(x p o)` itself holds, and
//!   without touching the original quotation. That is classic-vocabulary
//!   reasoning, not substitution inside a quote; it is pinned by
//!   `same_as_variants_arrive_only_via_the_transparent_bridge` in
//!   tests/owl_reify.rs. For consumers that want even that composition
//!   suppressed, [`ReifyMode::DestructureOnly`] (the STRICT-OPACITY mode, second
//!   increment) runs reif-dtr alone: inference then never mints a triple term at
//!   all, so no quotation — variant or otherwise — can ever be introduced by
//!   reasoning. Drive it via [`crate::materialize_owl_rl_reify`] (batch) or
//!   [`crate::MaterializedOwlGraph::with_reify_mode`] (incremental);
//!   [`crate::materialize_owl_rl`] / [`crate::MaterializedOwlGraph::new`] keep the
//!   full bridge.
//! * Only the OUTER quotation is destructured — a component that is itself a
//!   triple term stays one opaque id.
//! * Reasoning over reifier ANNOTATIONS (`{| … |}` blocks) needs no new machinery:
//!   annotations are ordinary triples about the reifier node, and the full RL rule
//!   set applies to them without ever touching the quoted triple. What reif-dtr
//!   adds is a deliberate, monotone projection: the DESTRUCTURED components are
//!   transparent ordinary terms, while the triple term itself remains opaque.
//!
//! # Increment scope
//!
//! One naive O(|closure|) pass per outer round, single-threaded, alternated with
//! the batch RL core (correct, not yet fused into the semi-naive delta loop);
//! `MaterializedOwlGraph` routes any base that mentions the reification vocabulary
//! to its documented Fallback mode (re-materialize per mutation) rather than
//! teaching the counting modes these rules. See the first-increment PR body (#2135)
//! for the follow-up list. The second increment ([FABLE-5] sq-afun3) added the
//! strict-opacity [`ReifyMode`] surface (batch only). The third increment
//! ([OPUS-5] sq-afun3) plumbed that mode through the incremental handle:
//! [`crate::MaterializedOwlGraph::with_reify_mode`] fixes the mode at construction
//! and every Fallback re-materialization — the initial one and every mutation's —
//! runs it, so the type's closure-equals-from-scratch invariant now holds against
//! the MATCHING batch oracle ([`crate::materialize_owl_rl_reify`] in the same mode)
//! and strict opacity is reachable incrementally. Still open (unchanged): the
//! counting modes model neither bridge rule, so reify-vocabulary bases stay in
//! Fallback in BOTH modes, and the reify step is still the naive per-round scan
//! rather than a semi-naive delta.
