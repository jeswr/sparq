//! [FABLE-5] sq-gwayp — pins the container-`default` walk contract of
//! [`PodStore::resolve_acl`] against the depth-4 `wac_fixture()` pod, through the PUBLIC
//! API only (read-only w.r.t. `src/`):
//!
//! 1. the target's OWN `.acl` (`acl:accessTo`) fully overrides any ancestor;
//! 2. with no own ACL, the NEAREST ancestor container with an ACL governs via
//!    [`AclScope::Default`] and the walk STOPS there — no union across levels
//!    (child → root);
//! 3. no ACL anywhere up to the storage root ⇒ deny (fail-closed).
//!
//! Anti-vacuity witness: [`inheritance_depth_witness_at_least_two_levels`] asserts the
//! fixture actually EXERCISES ≥2-level inheritance — a resource whose governing ACL is
//! the ROOT `.acl` with an intermediate container that has NO ACL of its own — so this
//! suite cannot pass on a degenerate one-level (own-parent-only) fixture.
