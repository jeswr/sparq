//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-2xdr — behavioural tests for the query-rewrite path
//! ([`sparq_solid::rewrite_for`] / [`sparq_solid::wrap_for_view`]).
//!
//! These exercise the recursive `wrap_in_graph` / `wrap_expr` walk over the SPARQL
//! algebra (the lowest-covered module of the crate): every structural operator must
//! (a) push each default-graph triple/path pattern under its own `GRAPH ?fresh { … }`
//! scope, (b) leave patterns already inside a `GRAPH`/`SERVICE` scope alone, and
//! (c) still produce a query that round-trips through the SPARQL parser. The asserts
//! are behavioural — that the rewrite preserves authorized-graph scoping semantics —
//! not vacuous line-touchers.
