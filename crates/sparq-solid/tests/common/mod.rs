//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-t58w.6 — the **single reusable source** for the WAC/ACP parity corpus.
//!
//! The scenario corpus (the `AclBuilder`/`AcrBuilder`-emitted `.acl`/`.acr` data + the
//! `Expect` decision tables, 13 WAC + 13 ACP) lived inline in `conformance_wac.rs` /
//! `conformance_acp.rs`. It is extracted here, unchanged, so it is reachable by a SECOND
//! integration-test target without copy-paste — the differential oracle (`sq-t58w.7`,
//! `tests/differential_oracle.rs`) consumes the IDENTICAL scenarios. "One corpus, two
//! consumers." Design: `research/solid-acp-differential-oracle-design.md` §3.2 / §5.
//!
//! This is a pure test-infra move: NO change to the scenarios, the emitted RDF, or the
//! expected decisions. The `WacScenario` / `AcpScenario` / `Expect` / `Decision` types are
//! already public crate API (`sparq_solid::wac_conformance` / `sparq_solid::conformance`),
//! so any test target can build and run a corpus from them; what was *not* shared — and is
//! shared here — is the scenario builders, the corpus assembly, and the floor constants.
//!
//! Each conformance test file does `mod common;` and calls `common::wac_corpus()` /
//! `common::acp_corpus()`. Cargo compiles this file once per consuming test binary; a
//! `#![allow(dead_code)]` keeps a consumer that uses only part of the surface warning-free.

// expected-unused; allow it rather than splitting the shared module per consumer.
