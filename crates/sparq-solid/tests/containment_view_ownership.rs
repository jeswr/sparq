//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-3jtd.4 — `ldp:contains` / containment-view OWNERSHIP decision guard.
//!
//! DECISION (research/solid-access-control-design.md §2.1 / §7.7,
//! research/sparq-solid-scope.md area 2): a container's `ldp:contains` listing is
//! **PSS-written explicit content**, NOT a sparq-derived/materialized view. sparq-solid
//! derives *ancestry* structurally from IRI slash-semantics (`solidx:parent`/
//! `solidx:ancestor`, §3.2) purely to drive ACL inheritance, and **never**:
//!   - derives `ldp:contains` from structure,
//!   - mutates or re-derives `ldp:contains` on a write, or
//!   - reads `ldp:contains` from pod content into the reasoner.
//!
//! These tests pin that boundary so the codebase cannot silently drift toward
//! sparq-owned containment. If PSS ever asks sparq to own containment derivation it is a
//! separate, explicitly-scoped structural-only spike (the bead body) — and these tests
//! would be the thing that has to change deliberately.
