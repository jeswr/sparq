//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-3jtd.8 — the WAC **conformance corpus**: a table of independent, minimal
//! scenarios, each isolating one Solid WAC-spec construct, run through this crate's WAC
//! authorization engine (`materialize_wac` + `AuthIndex::accessible`) with its expected
//! `(agent, client, mode, resource) → allow | deny` decisions asserted.
//!
//! Decision: the conformance surface is the Solid WAC spec
//! (<https://solidproject.org/TR/wac>) at the library level — see the harness module
//! `src/wac_conformance.rs` for the full rationale (why CTH-over-HTTP and the JS-reference
//! differential oracle are out-of-scope / research-open). This is the near-term-feasible
//! conformance signal called for in `research/sparq-solid-scope.md` §4. The harness lets
//! each scenario fail independently and reports all mismatches at once.
//!
//! The scenarios are derived from the WAC spec's normative semantics, NOT vendored over
//! HTTP from the live `solid/specification-tests` / CTH corpus — that corpus asserts on
//! HTTP-shaped outputs (status codes, the `WAC-Allow` header) which have no library entry
//! point here (they are PSS's by design, gh-55). The decision table is the authorization
//! *content* of those tests (the `.acl` shapes and their expected allow/deny per
//! principal), which is exactly what an authorization oracle can reproduce.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-t58w.6 — the scenario corpus itself now lives in the shared `tests/common`
//! module (`common::wac_corpus()`) so a SECOND test target (the differential oracle,
//! `sq-t58w.7`) can consume the IDENTICAL scenarios without copy-paste. This file is the
//! corpus's first consumer; the test set + assertions below are unchanged by the move.
