//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-3jtd.9 — a library-level **ACP conformance harness**.
//!
//! # What this is (and the decision behind it)
//!
//! The conformance surface targeted here is the **Solid Access Control Policy (ACP)
//! specification** — <https://solidproject.org/TR/acp> — exercised at the *library*
//! level: a scenario is an ACR-document corpus plus a table of expected
//! `(agent, client, mode, resource) → allow | deny` decisions, and the harness asserts
//! that this crate's ACP authorization engine
//! ([`crate::materialize_acp`] + [`crate::AuthIndex::accessible`]) reproduces every
//! expected decision (`research/sparq-solid-scope.md` §4).
//!
//! This is the **realistic, achievable** conformance signal for an authorization
//! *oracle*. Two routes were considered and deliberately NOT taken here:
//!
//! - **CTH-over-HTTP** (the Solid Conformance Test Harness / `solid/specification-tests`)
//!   drives a *server* and asserts on HTTP outputs (status codes, `WAC-Allow`). This
//!   crate has no HTTP surface — that route is out-of-scope (it belongs to the Solid
//!   server, conformance-tested *through* the server), per the scope record.
//! - **A differential oracle against a JS reference evaluator** (Community Solid Server /
//!   Inrupt ESS — same corpus, diff decisions) is the credible *second* oracle, but is
//!   research-open (JS-toolchain cost) and tracked as a follow-up — it is NOT built here.
//!
//! Instead, scenarios are declared as **data** (this module is a builder + runner), and
//! the expected-decision table is derived from the ACP spec's normative semantics:
//! matchers (`acp:agent` / `acp:client`, `acp:PublicAgent`, `acp:AuthenticatedAgent`),
//! policies (`acp:allow` / `acp:deny`, `acp:allOf` / `acp:anyOf` / `acp:noneOf`), and
//! access control with **cumulative** ancestor inheritance
//! (`acp:accessControl` / `acp:memberAccessControl`). The corpus that consumes this
//! harness lives in `tests/conformance_acp.rs`.
//!
//! # Relationship to `tests/acp.rs`
//!
//! `tests/acp.rs` asserts a hand-derived access *matrix* over the one big synthetic
//! `acp_fixture()` pod — bespoke, internally authored. This harness is structurally
//! different: it is **table-driven over independent, minimal scenarios**, each isolating
//! one ACP construct, with a uniform pass/fail report. The two are complementary: the
//! matrix exercises depth and interaction on a realistic pod; this harness exercises
//! spec-construct coverage with small, auditable, independently-failing cases.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use sparq_solid::conformance::{AcrBuilder, AcpScenario, Decision, Expect};
//! use sparq_solid::Mode;
//!
//! let alice = "https://alice.example/card#me";
//! let bob = "https://bob.example/card#me";
//! let doc = "https://pod.example/notes/n1";
//!
//! // An ACR on the document grants Read to exactly { alice } via an anyOf agent matcher.
//! let mut acr = AcrBuilder::new();
//! acr.access_control(doc, |p| p.allow(Mode::Read).any_of_agent(alice));
//! acr.document(doc); // the protected resource is a (possibly empty) named graph
//!
//! let scenario = AcpScenario::new("agent-allow")
//!     .acr(acr)
//!     .expect(Expect::agent(alice).read(doc).is(Decision::Allow))
//!     .expect(Expect::agent(bob).read(doc).is(Decision::Deny))
//!     .expect(Expect::anonymous().read(doc).is(Decision::Deny));
//!
//! let report = scenario.run().expect("materializes");
//! assert!(report.passed(), "{report}"); // every expected decision reproduced
//! ```
