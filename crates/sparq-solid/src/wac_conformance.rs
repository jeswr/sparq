//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-3jtd.8 — a library-level **WAC conformance harness**.
//!
//! # What this is (and the decision behind it)
//!
//! The conformance surface targeted here is the **Solid Web Access Control (WAC)
//! specification** — <https://solidproject.org/TR/wac> — exercised at the *library*
//! level: a scenario is an `.acl`-document corpus plus a table of expected
//! `(agent, client, mode, resource) → allow | deny` decisions, and the harness asserts
//! that this crate's WAC authorization engine
//! ([`crate::materialize_wac`] + [`crate::AuthIndex::accessible`]) reproduces every
//! expected decision (`research/sparq-solid-scope.md` §4).
//!
//! This is the **realistic, achievable** conformance signal for an authorization
//! *oracle*. Two routes were considered and deliberately NOT taken here (identical
//! reasoning to the ACP harness in [`crate::conformance`] — kept in sync):
//!
//! - **CTH-over-HTTP** (the Solid Conformance Test Harness / `solid/specification-tests`)
//!   drives a *server* and asserts on HTTP outputs (status codes, the `WAC-Allow`
//!   header). This crate has no HTTP surface — that route is out-of-scope (it belongs
//!   to the Solid server, conformance-tested *through* the server), per the scope record.
//! - **A differential oracle against a JS reference evaluator** (Community Solid Server —
//!   same corpus, diff decisions) is the credible *second* oracle, but is research-open
//!   (JS-toolchain cost) and tracked as a follow-up — it is NOT built here.
//!
//! Instead, scenarios are declared as **data** (this module is a builder + runner), and
//! the expected-decision table is derived from the WAC spec's normative semantics:
//! ACL resolution (`acl:accessTo` on the resource's own ACL vs. `acl:default` on the
//! **nearest** ancestor with an ACL — nearest-wins, NOT cumulative), access subjects
//! (`acl:agent` / `acl:agentClass` `foaf:Agent` (public) / `acl:AuthenticatedAgent` /
//! `acl:agentGroup` via `vcard:hasMember` / `acl:origin` minting an (agent, client) pair),
//! and access modes (`acl:Read`/`Write`/`Append`/`Control`, where `Control` governs the
//! **ACL document** of the resource, not the resource). The corpus that consumes this
//! harness lives in `tests/conformance_wac.rs`.
//!
//! # Relationship to the ACP harness and to `tests/wac.rs`
//!
//! The decision/expectation/report vocabulary ([`Decision`](crate::conformance::Decision),
//! [`Expect`], [`ScenarioReport`]) is **shared** with the ACP harness
//! ([`crate::conformance`]) — both compare the same
//! `(agent, client, mode, resource) → allow | deny` binary against the same
//! [`AuthIndex::accessible`] verdict; only the *corpus shape* differs (`.acl`
//! authorizations here, `.acr` policies there). This module adds the WAC-specific corpus
//! builder ([`AclBuilder`]) and runner ([`WacScenario`]).
//!
//! `tests/wac.rs` asserts a hand-derived access *matrix* over the one big synthetic
//! `wac_fixture()` pod — bespoke, internally authored, depth-4. This harness is
//! structurally different: it is **table-driven over independent, minimal scenarios**,
//! each isolating one WAC construct, with a uniform pass/fail report. The two are
//! complementary: the matrix exercises depth and interaction on a realistic pod; this
//! harness exercises spec-construct coverage with small, auditable, independently-failing
//! cases (the natural input for the aspirational CSS differential oracle).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use sparq_solid::wac_conformance::{AclBuilder, WacScenario};
//! use sparq_solid::conformance::{Decision, Expect};
//! use sparq_solid::Mode;
//!
//! let alice = "https://alice.example/card#me";
//! let bob = "https://bob.example/card#me";
//! let doc = "https://pod.example/notes/n1";
//!
//! // An ACL on the document grants Read to exactly { alice } via `acl:accessTo`.
//! let mut acl = AclBuilder::new();
//! acl.access_to(doc, |a| a.agent(alice).mode(Mode::Read));
//! acl.document(doc); // the protected resource is a (possibly empty) named graph
//!
//! let scenario = WacScenario::new("agent-allow")
//!     .acl(acl)
//!     .expect(Expect::agent(alice).read(doc).is(Decision::Allow))
//!     .expect(Expect::agent(bob).read(doc).is(Decision::Deny))
//!     .expect(Expect::anonymous().read(doc).is(Decision::Deny));
//!
//! let report = scenario.run().expect("materializes");
//! assert!(report.passed(), "{report}"); // every expected decision reproduced
