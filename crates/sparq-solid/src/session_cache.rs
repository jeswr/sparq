//! [FABLE-5] sq-cnuqd (issue #1569) — the BOUNDED, SHARDED, `&self`-readable session cache.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Before this, every read-side entry point on [`crate::PodStore`] (`accessible`,
//! `accessible_set`, `view_for`, `query_as`, `query_json_as`, `ask_as`, `wac_allow`)
//! took `&mut self`, because the memoized authorized-graph-set cache was a plain
//! `FxHashMap` mutated in place. That EXCLUSIVE borrow serialised every concurrent
//! reader through one lock even though the underlying engine, the `Arc<Generation>`
//! graph ring, and the `Arc<AuthIndex>` are all read-only after materialization — so a
//! per-request LDP/SPARQL server sharing one `&PodStore` across threads could not run
//! two queries at once (issue #1569, the PSS >50k req/s target).
//!
//! This module replaces that map with a cache that is:
//!
//! - **`&self`-readable** — interior mutability ([`std::sync::RwLock`] per shard), so all
//!   read entry points take `&self` and `&PodStore: Sync` lets N threads read concurrently.
//! - **sharded** — [`SHARDS`] independent lock stripes keyed by the session-key hash, so
//!   two requests for DIFFERENT sessions almost never contend on the same lock. A cache
//!   HIT is a shard read-lock + two `Arc` clones; only a cache MISS (or eviction) takes
//!   that shard's write lock, and only that one shard.
//! - **bounded** — each shard holds at most [`SHARD_CAP`] entries with LRU eviction
//!   ([`Shard::recency`]), so a server passing per-request `now` timestamps (which key
//!   distinctly, [`crate::SessionKey`]) can no longer grow the cache without bound. The LRU
//!   recency queue is ALSO bounded (compacted to one entry per live key once it exceeds
//!   `RECENCY_SLACK * SHARD_CAP`), so re-touching a hot key under invalidation churn cannot
//!   grow it without bound either.
//!
//! # Exact-semantics preservation (the load-bearing invariant)
//!
//! The cache is a TRANSIENT index over the auth-view triples (design doc D3) — it holds
//! zero authorization state of record. It composes with the recently-landed AclIndex
//! (#1577), generation pinning (#1584) and diff-based origin-scoped invalidation (#1585)
//! by keeping their exact seams:
//!
//! - **generation pinning / snapshot consistency** — a read pins `Arc::clone(&self.auth)`
//!   ONCE and computes the whole set against that one snapshot, so a re-materialization
//!   racing a read never yields a half-old/half-new set (the read either sees the whole
//!   old generation or, on the next read after `reindex`, the whole new one).
//! - **invalidation still hits the right shards** — [`SessionCache::clear`] drops every
//!   shard; [`SessionCache::invalidate_origin`] visits EVERY shard and applies the SAME
//!   per-entry origin surgery the pre-sharded map did (drop the origin's slice, mark it
//!   `dirty`, drop the memo), so the diff-based per-origin invalidation still reaches every
//!   cached session regardless of which shard it landed in. Eviction is pure capacity
//!   management and can only ever DROP a cached set (which is re-derived, fail-closed on
//!   the current auth view) — it can never surface a stale grant.
//!
//! Fail-closed throughout: a dropped/evicted entry is simply re-derived from the current
//! `AuthIndex`, never assumed to still be authorized.
