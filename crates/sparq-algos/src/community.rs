//! Community detection over a [`NodeGraph`].
//!
//! Two complementary passes:
//!
//! * [`weakly_connected_components`] — the exact partition into **weakly connected
//!   components** (treat every edge as undirected; two nodes share a component iff a path
//!   of edges connects them ignoring direction). Computed with a near-linear union-find.
//!   This is a *structural* community: it answers "which entities are reachable from each
//!   other at all".
//!
//! * [`label_propagation`] — the classic near-linear **label-propagation** community
//!   heuristic (Raghavan, Albert, Kumara 2007): each node adopts the label held by the
//!   plurality of its neighbours, iterated to a fixed point. This finds *denser*
//!   communities within a connected component (a connected component can contain several
//!   label-propagation communities). It is a heuristic, made deterministic here by a fixed
//!   visiting order and an ascending-id tie-break, so repeated runs on the same graph give
//!   the same partition. [OPUS-4.8] sq-lqty: the "fixed visiting order" is the node index
//!   order, which [`NodeGraph`] now assigns CANONICALLY (ascending term), so the partition
//!   is also identical across hosts — it no longer depends on the dictionary-id order that
//!   the parallel loader assigns thread-count-dependently.
//!
//! Both return a `Vec<usize>` labelling: `labels[i]` is the community id of node `i`.
//! Community ids are dense (`0..num_communities`) and assigned in ascending-node order so
//! the smallest member's first-seen position determines the id — again for determinism.
