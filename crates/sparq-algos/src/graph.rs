//! The directed adjacency view that every algorithm in this crate runs over.
//!
//! [`NodeGraph`] projects a [`sparq_core::Graph`] onto a *node graph*: subjects and
//! objects of triples become **nodes**, and each triple `(s, p, o)` contributes a
//! directed edge `s → o` (the predicate `p` is dropped — these are *topology* algorithms;
//! see the crate docs for predicate filtering). The projection is built once, in a single
//! pass over `Graph::iter_ids`, and is keyed by **dense, contiguous node indices**
//! (`0..n`) so the algorithms can use flat `Vec`s rather than hash maps on the hot path.
//! Each node index maps back to its sparq-core dictionary [`Id`] (and hence to an
//! [`oxrdf::Term`]) via [`NodeGraph::dict_id`] / [`NodeGraph::term`].
//!
//! Only **IRI and blank-node** terms become nodes by default: an RDF *literal* in the
//! object position is data, not a graph vertex, and including literals would let, e.g.,
//! every entity with `foaf:age 30` share a "neighbour". Pass [`NodeFilter::All`] to
//! [`NodeGraph::build_with`] to include literal objects as nodes too.
