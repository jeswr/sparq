//! Directed topology algorithms over a [`NodeGraph`].

//! [GPT-5.6] sq-lsp7k.20: unlike the crate's weak community and extended-centrality
//! passes, both algorithms in this module preserve edge direction. Strongly connected
//! components use an iterative Tarjan traversal, and topological sorting uses Kahn's
//! algorithm with an ascending-node ready queue. Neither algorithm uses recursion or RNG.
