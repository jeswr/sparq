//! SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query — `SERVICE` evaluation. [OPUS-4.8]
//!
//! `SERVICE <endpoint> { pattern }` evaluates `pattern` against a *remote* SPARQL
//! endpoint and joins the returned solutions back into the surrounding query, per
//! <https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/>.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! 1. The inner `GraphPattern` is wrapped as `SELECT * WHERE { <inner> }` using
//!    spargebra's `Display` impl (which round-trips algebra → SPARQL syntax), so the
//!    full pattern (BGPs, OPTIONAL, FILTER, sub-SELECT, …) is forwarded.
//!
//!    **Bind-join (`VALUES` pushdown).** When the SERVICE is the right side of a join
//!    (or `OPTIONAL`) whose join variables are already bound by the left side, the
//!    caller (`exec::try_bound_join_service`) pushes a *block* of those bindings into
//!    the wrapped query as a `VALUES` clause — `SELECT * WHERE { VALUES (?j…) { … }
//!    <inner> }` — so the remote returns only the rows that can survive the local join
//!    (the brTPF/FedX "bound join", bead sq-sjkj). This is ON by default and
//!    correctness-preserving; it FALLS BACK to forwarding the bare pattern verbatim
//!    when it does not apply (variable endpoint, no bound join var, a join key bound to
//!    a blank node, …). The block size is the one OPT-IN tuning knob
//!    ([`with_service_bound_join_block_size`] / `SPARQ_SERVICE_BIND_BLOCK`,
//!    default `DEFAULT_BIND_BLOCK`). The remote relation that is NOT bound-joined is
//!    still fetched in full and consumed row-by-row into the caller's id-level join
//!    input (see *Bounded result consumption* below).
//! 2. The query is sent over HTTP (form-encoded POST, `Accept:
//!    application/sparql-results+json, application/sparql-results+xml;q=0.9` — JSON is
//!    preferred but XML is accepted as a fallback).
//! 3. The response is parsed INCREMENTALLY (`parse_results_into`, bead sq-my8wd.4):
//!    each solution row (`Vec<Option<Term>>`, `None` = unbound) is handed to the
//!    caller's row sink AS IT IS PARSED — the parser never materialises the whole
//!    remote relation, and a sink error aborts the parse. The body is content-sniffed:
//!    a leading `{` is parsed as SPARQL-Results-JSON (`parse_srj_into`); a leading
//!    `<` as SPARQL-Results-XML (`parse_srx_into`). The XML path matters because
//!    some endpoints ignore `Accept` and always return XML — without it the whole
//!    SERVICE call would fail (bead sq-ycu).
//! 4. The caller (`exec::eval_service`) interns each row into the local/graph
//!    dictionaries as it arrives — exactly like `VALUES` — dropping the owned terms
//!    immediately, and joins the compact id-level relation with the rest of the query.
//!
//! ## Bounded result consumption (bead sq-my8wd.4)
//!
//! A large (or adversarial) remote result must not exhaust engine memory. The bounds:
//!
//! * the raw response BODY is capped at a finite limit (`SERVICE_MAX_BODY_BYTES`, the
//!   native transport's read limit) — a runaway endpoint cannot stream unbounded bytes;
//! * parsing is per-row streaming for BOTH result formats: the SRJ parser walks the
//!   `results.bindings` array one binding object at a time (never building a whole-
//!   document JSON DOM), and the SRX parser was already event-driven — so the parser's
//!   own working state is one solution, not the relation;
//! * the consumer interns rows to id-level `Bindings` on arrival, so the only
//!   result-sized state is the compact id relation the join itself requires.
//!
//! Result-equivalence with the previous collect-everything path (identical rows,
//! multiplicity AND order, and identical errors on malformed documents) is pinned by
//! the `streaming_equivalence` tests against a frozen DOM reference implementation.
//! Honest boundary: an SRJ document whose `results` precedes its `head` (legal JSON,
//! unseen in practice) degrades to buffering the raw binding objects until `head`
//! arrives — still bounded by the body cap; and on documents with DUPLICATE top-level
//! keys (malformed per RFC 8259 §4) the error/row precedence may reflect document
//! order rather than the old DOM's fixed check order.
//!
//! ## `SERVICE SILENT`
//!
//! Any error (DNS, connection, non-2xx status, malformed body) is swallowed when the
//! pattern is `SILENT`: evaluation yields the join identity (a single empty solution),
//! so the surrounding query keeps its existing bindings rather than failing. Without
//! `SILENT`, the error propagates and fails the query.
//!
//! ## Transport seam (testability)
//!
//! The HTTP call sits behind the [`Transport`] trait. Production uses [`HttpTransport`]
//! (ureq, a tiny blocking client — gated off wasm). Tests inject a canned-response or
//! local-loopback transport, so the SRJ parser and the algebra integration are
//! exercised without a public network dependency.
//!
//! ## `SERVICE ?var` (variable endpoint)
//!
//! `SERVICE ?ep { P }` — where the endpoint is a *variable* — is supported when `?ep` is
//! bound by the surrounding query (bead sq-d4p). The engine evaluates it per SPARQL 1.1
//! semantics (one substituted `SERVICE μ(?ep) { P }` per in-scope solution μ): it
//! partitions the already-evaluated left bindings by their `?ep` value and dispatches one
//! bind-join *per distinct endpoint IRI*, tagging each remote row with its `?ep` so the
//! surrounding join re-attaches it (see `exec::bound_join_variable_endpoint`). A left
//! solution whose `?ep` is UNBOUND or not an IRI names no valid endpoint and contributes
//! no federated answer. A TOP-LEVEL `SERVICE ?ep` with nothing to bind it (no surrounding
//! relation) has no endpoint to call and is still rejected with a clear error (or, under
//! `SILENT`, the empty result) — see `exec::eval_service`.
//!
//! ## Timeout
//!
//! The remote round-trip is bounded by the active `QueryBudget`
//! deadline (bead sq-d4p): [`HttpTransport::with_budget`] caps its socket timeout at the
//! budget's remaining time (never above the built-in `DEFAULT_SERVICE_TIMEOUT`), so a
//! query under a tight deadline does not block for the full default on an unresponsive
//! endpoint. With no deadline installed the built-in default applies.

// Bind-join (VALUES pushdown) into SERVICE — block size knob [OPUS-4.8] (sq-sjkj)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// When a SERVICE sub-query is the right side of a join whose join variables are
// already bound by the left side, we push a *block* of those bindings into the
// remote query as a `VALUES` clause (SPARQL 1.1 §10.2.1) — one remote request per
// block instead of materialising the whole remote relation and joining locally.
// This is the brTPF/FedX "bound join" (bead sq-sjkj, research candidate C1): for a
// selective join it slashes the data the endpoint returns and the rows we filter.
//
// The pushdown is a *correctness-preserving* optimisation of the existing SERVICE
// path: injecting `VALUES (?j) { (v1) (v2) … }` restricts the remote pattern to
// exactly the bound tuples, and the surrounding query joins the result back the
// same way it joins the unbound relation — so the answer is identical. It is ON by
// default (no new surface, zero downside on the applicable shape) and FALLS BACK to
// the verbatim path whenever it does not apply (variable endpoint, no bound join
// var, a join key bound to a blank node, an empty left side, …). The only TUNING
// KNOB — the block size — is OPT-IN via [`with_service_bound_join_block_size`] /
// the `SPARQ_SERVICE_BIND_BLOCK` env var; the default suits typical workloads.

// bead sq-2v6f). With no egress filter that is a textbook SSRF primitive into
// the internal network — the worst case being the cloud-metadata endpoint
// 169.254.169.254, which on most clouds hands out credentials. The DEFAULT here
// is therefore DENY: a SERVICE endpoint that resolves to any non-global address
// is refused, and a deployer must explicitly opt a host/range back in via the
// allowlist (mirroring how `update.rs` gates `LOAD file://` behind
// `with_load_base`).
//
// DNS-rebinding safety: the check runs on the *resolved* IP, not the literal IRI
// host, and the production transport installs the policy as ureq's `Resolver`.

/// ## Port scoping ([OPUS-4.8] sq-a7jw4)

/// An allowlist entry may be **host-level** (`sparql.internal`, `127.0.0.1`,
/// `.example.org`) or **port-scoped** (`127.0.0.1:8053`, `sparql.internal:8443`,
/// `.example.org:443`). A host-level entry keeps its original meaning — it permits the
/// host on *every* port. A port-scoped entry is strictly NARROWER: it permits the host
/// ONLY on that exact port and rejects every other port on the same host. This lets a
/// deployer (or the in-process loopback SERVICE federation harness) re-open exactly
/// `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` without re-opening the whole loopback host. There is no
/// wildcard port — a port-scoped entry tightens, never loosens; default-deny stays
/// default-deny.
///
/// The port checked is the SERVICE IRI authority's port (its explicit `:port`, or the
/// scheme default 443/80), which is exactly the port `to_socket_addrs(host:port)` dials
/// for *every* resolved address — so port-scoping applies to the post-resolution connect
/// target and cannot be bypassed by DNS rebinding (the resolved IP is still re-vetted by
/// [`is_forbidden_ip`] at connect time; the allowlist exemption only fires when BOTH the
/// host pattern AND the port constraint match).
///
/// Two modes (the [`Mode`] flag), both default-deny but at different strictnesses:
///
/// * **`Mode::DenyPrivate`** (the engine's standalone default, installed by
///   [`with_service_egress_allow`]): public IPs are reachable, private/internal IPs
///   are refused unless the host is on the allowlist. Allowlist entries only *add*
///   permission (re-open a private host).
/// * **`Mode::AllowlistOnly`** (the strict mode the *server* uses, installed by
///   [`with_service_egress_policy`]): ONLY hosts on the allowlist may be reached at
///   all — every other host is refused even if it resolves to a public address. An
///   empty allowlist in this mode is therefore "deny ALL SERVICE", which is the
///   server's safe default for the network-exposed surface.
///
/// Empty + `DenyPrivate` (the thread-local default before any scope installs a
/// policy) preserves the original behaviour: public allowed, private denied.
/// Installed for a scope via [`with_service_egress_allow`] /
