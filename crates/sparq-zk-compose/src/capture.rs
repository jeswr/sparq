// [OPUS-4.8] sq-1s2.3 (FL1 follow-up): package NATIVE per-circuit proofs into the
// browser-shippable captured ProofManifest for /showcase/zk-car-hire.
//! Browser-shippable **captured** ProofManifest packaging (sq-1s2.3 / FL1 follow-up).
//!
//! The `/showcase/zk-car-hire` flagship proves the age-gate FILTER live in the
//! browser, and offers a *fallback* that fetches a pre-captured manifest and runs a
//! real `bb.js verifyProof` over its bundled sub-proof in-tab. Today that fallback
//! bundles ONLY the age-gate (`site/scripts/capture-zk-manifest.mjs`), because the
//! other family members (scan / join_eq / hidden_issuer / revoke_unset / holder_pok)
//! need NATIVE witness generation — Poseidon commitments, Schnorr signatures, Merkle
//! roots — that is not feasible in JS.
//!
//! This module is the crate-side seam that lets the fuller manifest be assembled: it
//! takes the [`crate::driver::ProofArtifacts`] a [`crate::driver::CircuitProver`]
//! produces for each member and packages them into the exact JSON shape the site's
//! fallback consumes — the raw UltraHonk `proof` bytes as a JSON-portable `number[]`,
//! and bb's flat `public_inputs` blob split into the `0x`-prefixed 32-byte
//! big-endian field-hex words bb.js reports as `publicInputs: string[]`.
//!
//! # Browser re-verify caveat (target flavour)
//! bb.js re-verifies under a chosen `verifierTarget` (the car-hire page uses `evm`,
//! the keccak-oracle flavour). A captured sub-proof re-verifies in-tab ONLY if it was
//! proved under the matching bb flavour. The default [`crate::driver::CircuitProver`]
//! proves with the `noir-recursive` target; capturing for the browser fallback
//! requires proving with the `evm`/keccak flavour. Selecting that native proving
//! flavour is a separate driver concern (tracked as a follow-up); this module only
//! packages whatever artifacts it is handed, and asserts nothing about which flavour
//! produced them.
//!
//! # HONESTY (privacy-claims gate)
//! Research-grade, NOT externally audited (bead `sq-qhy4`). A bundled sub-proof
//! re-verified in-tab demonstrates only that it is a valid UltraHonk proof of THAT
//! circuit against THOSE public inputs — it does NOT establish that the
//! cross-credential COMPOSITION is sound (the composition verifier is NOT-yet-sound,
//! `sq-qhy4`). No soundness or privacy property is asserted as achieved. See
//! [`CAR_HIRE_CAPTURE_NOTE`], which is baked into every assembled manifest.
