//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-5enp) Streamed-equals-batch window ORACLE + window-semantics
//! tests for sparq-rsp.
//!
//! The crate's S2R window machinery (`window.rs`), R2R materialisation
//! (`eval.rs`) and the continuous-query pipeline (`query.rs`) carried no INLINE
//! unit tests — coverage came entirely from the three integration files, which
//! pin *bounds* and *content* but never independently re-derive the
//! window→result mapping. This file adds the missing differential oracle and the
//! window-semantics edge cases the audit flagged:
//!
//! 1. **Streamed-equals-batch differential** — feed a timestamped tuple stream
//!    through a [`ContinuousQuery`]; for every emitted window independently
//!    rebuild the STATIC graph of exactly the tuples that window should contain
//!    (per the documented `[start, end)` inclusivity) and run the SAME query via
//!    the batch engine; assert the streamed window result == the batch result.
//!    Mirrors sparq-engine's `query_json_matches_materialized_json` philosophy:
//!    the fast/incremental path must equal the obvious/materialised path.
//! 2. **Boundary inclusivity** — tuples exactly on an open/close boundary land
//!    in the correct window(s) (the half-open `[start, end)` convention).
//! 3. **Late / out-of-order** — handled per the documented watermark policy
//!    (kept if a covering window is still open, dropped + counted once every
//!    covering window has closed).
//! 4. **Eviction + report-strategy determinism** — evicted windows never leak
//!    into later results; repeated identical runs are byte-identical.
//! 5. **EvalMode 4-way equivalence** — Rebuild / PersistentDict / Delta /
//!    Snapshot produce the same per-window result against the oracle on the
//!    same stream.
//!
//! The oracle is deliberately INDEPENDENT of `eval.rs`: it re-implements the
//! window-membership predicate from the spec docs and uses the batch engine
//! (`sparq_engine::query`) as ground truth, so a bug in the incremental closure
//! /materialisation path would surface as a streamed-vs-batch divergence rather
//! than being masked by shared code.
