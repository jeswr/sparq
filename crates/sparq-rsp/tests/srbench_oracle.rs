//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-mcb3q (epic sq-2n1q3) — RSP EXPRESSIVITY / SRBench CORRECTNESS
//! oracle for `sparq-rsp`, wired into the central conformance scoreboard as a
//! sparq-EXTENSION ratchet (NOT a W3C/standards conformance claim).
//!
//! ## Why an EXTENSION ratchet, not a conformance one (the HONEST scope)
//!
//! SRBench (Zhang, Della Valle, Calbimonte et al., ISWC 2012) is the canonical
//! RSP correctness/expressivity *benchmark*, and RSP-QL is a W3C-COMMUNITY
//! spec — there is **no W3C/OGC/IETF Recommendation for RDF Stream Processing
//! and no normative RSP conformance test suite** to point at (unlike SPARQL,
//! SHACL, GeoSPARQL, JSON-LD, which this scoreboard ratchets as real
//! conformance). So this row is HONESTLY a sparq EXTENSION ratchet
//! (`family = "sparq extension"` in the scoreboard) — "sparq-rsp's windowed
//! continuous-query engine still produces the RSP-QL-correct answer on a fixed
//! SRBench-shaped battery" — never a standards-conformance claim. The unit is a
//! count of deterministic per-window CORRECTNESS assertions, not a spec
//! pass-count, so the scoreboard tallies it SEPARATELY and never folds it into a
//! conformance total.
//!
//! ## What this pins (the REAL streamed RSP path vs an INDEPENDENT oracle)
//!
//! Every assertion drives the crate's REAL public pipeline — `ContinuousQuery` /
//! `ContinuousMultiQuery` over `WindowSpec` windows, `EvalMode`-materialised,
//! `R2S`-filtered — and checks each closed window's result against an oracle that
//! shares NOTHING with the incremental closure/materialisation path:
//!
//! * **batch-rebuild differential** (the `window_oracle.rs` philosophy): for the
//!   window the spec says `[start, end)` should contain, rebuild the STATIC graph
//!   of exactly those tuples and run the SAME query through the batch engine
//!   (`sparq_engine::query`); the streamed window result MUST equal it.
//! * **closed-form expected rows**: for the SRBench-shaped multi-window joins
//!   and the R2S diffs we ALSO hand-derive the expected row multiset directly
//!   from the script, independent of the engine, so a drift in the join /
//!   aggregation / I-D-stream diff surfaces here.
//!
//! The battery spans the SRBench expressivity AXES: window TYPES (tumbling +
//! sliding time windows + CQL count windows), stream OPERATORS (RSTREAM /
//! ISTREAM / DSTREAM), all four `EvalMode`s (Rebuild / PersistentDict / Delta /
//! Snapshot — pinned to identical results), and MULTI-WINDOW JOINS
//! (observations ⋈ station-metadata, the SRBench weather shape) with
//! aggregate-after-join.
//!
//! ## Honest divergences (documented, NOT faked passes)
//!
//! sparq-rsp does not implement the whole RSP-QL surface; the bead scopes those
//! as DOCUMENTED gaps, never inflated into passes (see `NOT_RATCHETED` below and
//! the crate's `RspqlQuery` scope docs): named-window VARIABLES (`WINDOW ?w`),
//! `ROWS` count windows in the TEXTUAL surface grammar, and relative `NOW-PT…TO…`
//! window bounds. ISTREAM/DSTREAM over a multi-window join was a documented gap
//! but is now implemented ([SONNET-4.6] sq-2n1q3.3) and ratcheted in
//! `axis_multi_window_r2s`. The floor counts only what is actually executed and
//! checked.
//!
//! [SONNET-4.6] sq-z1xv8 — the floor is no longer MIRRORED anywhere. It is the one
//! `sparq_conformance_floors::rsp::EXPRESSIVITY_FLOOR` const, which the central
//! `sparq_conformance::scoreboard::SUITES` row imports too, so the enforced and the
//! reported floor cannot drift by construction (previously the conformance crate's
//! `tests/scoreboard_floors.rs` guard re-read this file's source). The dev-only
//! conformance crate still takes NO dependency edge on
//! sparq-rsp.
