//! Continuous queries: the RSP-QL pipeline glued together.
//!
//! [`ContinuousQuery`] owns one windowed stream (the S2R operator), one
//! registered SPARQL SELECT (validated at [`register`](ContinuousQuery::register)
//! time), and one [`R2S`] relation-to-stream operator. Every push drives the
//! window; every window that closes is materialised into a
//! [`sparq_core::Graph`] (set semantics — duplicate triples in the window
//! collapse, as in any RDF graph) by the configured [`EvalMode`], evaluated by
//! `sparq_engine`, run through the R2S operator, and handed to the caller's
//! callback as a [`WindowResult`].
//!
//! [`ContinuousConstruct`] is the stream-to-stream sibling: a registered
//! CONSTRUCT whose per-window result is itself an RDF graph, delivered as
//! [`GraphResult`]s (with R2S set-diff semantics over the constructed
//! triples). [`ContinuousAsk`] delivers one boolean per window.
//!
//! # R2S semantics (exact multiset differences)
//!
//! SPARQL SELECT results are multisets of rows. The three operators:
//!
//! * **RSTREAM** — every window emits its FULL result. Stateless.
//! * **ISTREAM** — every window emits the rows *added* relative to the previous
//!   window's result: the multiset difference `cur ∖ prev`. The first window
//!   diffs against the empty multiset, i.e. emits everything.
//! * **DSTREAM** — the rows *removed*: `prev ∖ cur`. The first window emits
//!   nothing. Note DSTREAM needs empty windows to be reported (they are — see
//!   [`crate::window`]): a result only "disappears" when a later, possibly
//!   empty, window closes without it.
//!
//! Diffs compare complete rows and count them as multisets, so a row appearing
//! twice in `cur` and once in `prev` ISTREAMs exactly once. Emission order is
//! deterministic: ISTREAM preserves the engine's row order of the current
//! window, DSTREAM the row order of the previous window.
//!
//! CONSTRUCT results are triple SETS (the engine dedups), so
//! [`ContinuousConstruct`]'s ISTREAM/DSTREAM are exact set differences over
//! full triples — no hashing caveat.
