//! [SONNET-4.6] sq-xqu: per-registered-query budget plumbing — the
//! [`QueryBudget`] a continuous query applies to EVERY window evaluation,
//! plus the optional per-window timeout that tightens the budget's deadline
//! at each evaluation start (a stored `deadline` is an ABSOLUTE instant, which
//! is the wrong shape for a long-lived registered query).

use sparq_engine::QueryBudget;

/// The registered budget configuration shared by all continuous-query forms.
///
/// `base` is applied to every window evaluation as-is: the row / byte caps and
/// the cancellation flag are naturally per-evaluation limits, while a
/// `deadline` inside it stays absolute (once it passes, every later window
/// fails). `per_window_timeout` is the relative form embedders actually want:
/// at each window evaluation start the effective deadline becomes the EARLIER
/// of the absolute deadline and `now + timeout`, bounding the worst-case cost
/// of ONE window without ever extending the absolute limit.
