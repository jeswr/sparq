//! Window operators (the RSP-QL S2R step): time-based sliding windows
//! (`RANGE w STEP s`), count-based windows (`ROWS n`), and opt-in
//! gap-triggered session windows.
//!
//! # Time-window semantics (read this; the tests pin it down)
//!
//! * Windows are **half-open intervals `[start, end)`** with `start = t0 + k·step`,
//!   `end = start + range`, for `k = 0, 1, 2, …` — i.e. the window origin
//!   `t0` defaults to timestamp `0` (the RSP-QL parameterised origin is set
//!   with [`WindowSpec::with_t0`]). A triple with timestamp `t` belongs to
//!   window `k` iff `start ≤ t < end`: the start bound is INCLUSIVE, the end
//!   bound EXCLUSIVE, so `RANGE 10 STEP 10` windows `[0,10) [10,20) …`
//!   partition the timeline with no double-counting. A triple with `t < t0`
//!   predates the stream origin: it belongs to no window (and is not counted
//!   late — no window ever covered it), but it still advances the watermark,
//!   exactly like a gap arrival.
//! * **Closure is watermark-driven, never wall-clock-driven.** The watermark is
//!   `max_ts_seen − max_delay` (saturating). Window `k` CLOSES — its content is
//!   frozen and reported — as soon as the watermark reaches its `end`. Time
//!   only advances through pushed timestamps, so a quiet stream closes nothing
//!   until the next push (or [`WindowedStream::flush`]).
//! * **Out-of-order arrivals** within `max_delay` land in every still-open
//!   window that covers their timestamp. A triple whose LAST covering window
//!   has already closed is dropped and counted in
//!   [`late_dropped`](WindowedStream::late_dropped); if only some earlier
//!   covering windows closed, it still enters the open ones (standard
//!   streaming-system behaviour) and is not counted as late.
//! * **Empty windows are reported.** When the watermark jumps a gap, every
//!   window in between closes with no content — DSTREAM needs this (results
//!   must be observed disappearing), and it keeps emission deterministic.
//!   Windows wholly closed at the INITIAL watermark (the first arrival's `ts`
//!   minus `max_delay` — gap arrivals included) are skipped, so a stream
//!   starting at `ts = 10⁹` does not replay a billion empties — while every
//!   window the watermark holds open stays open even across the first push: a
//!   first push at `ts = 12` with `max_delay = 5` leaves `[0, 10)` open for a
//!   later `ts = 8`.
//! * `step > range` leaves timestamp gaps covered by no window; a triple in a
//!   gap enters no window and is not counted "late" — but its timestamp still
//!   ADVANCES the watermark (event time passed), closing earlier windows.
//!
//! # Count-window semantics
//!
//! `ROWS n` follows CQL: the window holds the last `min(n, arrivals)` triples
//! in ARRIVAL order (timestamps are carried but do not influence membership),
//! and is reported on every arrival — or every `slide`-th arrival with
//! [`WindowSpec::with_slide`]. Reported bounds are the **inclusive**
//! `[first.ts, last.ts]` of the content (empty never occurs: a count window is
//! only reported after an arrival). [`flush`](WindowedStream::flush) is a
//! no-op for count windows — there is no watermark to advance.
//!
//! # Session-window semantics (`session_windows` feature)
//!
//! `WindowSpec::session(gap)` groups timestamp-ordered events into maximal
//! runs whose consecutive timestamp gaps are strictly less than `gap`. A gap
//! equal to `gap` starts a new session. Closure is event-time-only: a session
//! closes when the watermark reaches `last_event_ts + gap`; `flush` closes the
//! final open session. Reported bounds are the inclusive
//! `[first_event_ts, last_event_ts]` of the session content.
