/// (`sparq_substrate::join::delta::DeltaTable` over `sparq_substrate::rows::Row`)
/// instead of per-slide term-level hash sets.
///
/// ## Semi-naive shape
///
/// Per slide, the previous window is the persisted BUILD side and the closed
/// window is the probe (Δ) side, keyed on the full triple (all three id
/// columns): a probe miss against `prev_table` is an INSERT, a previous row
/// missing from the window's own freshly-built table is a DELETE, and that
/// fresh table then BECOMES `prev_table` — the previous window is never
/// re-hashed. That carried-over build side is exactly the extendable-table
/// property `DeltaTable` was built for (`research/substrate-remaining-design.md`
/// §3), where the old code rebuilt BOTH term-level hash sets on every slide.
///
/// ## Behaviour-neutrality (the load-bearing argument)
///
/// Diffing id-rows computes EXACTLY the sets the term-level diff computed,
/// because interning is injective on lexically-distinct terms: `Dict::intern`
/// assigns equal ids iff the terms are equal — inline ids exist only for the
/// CANONICAL `xsd:integer` lexical form (`"042"^^xsd:integer` stays a distinct
/// dictionary entry) and stored terms dedup on the exact
/// (value, datatype, lang) tuple — which is `oxrdf::Term` equality. The terms
/// handed to `Graph::apply_delta` are the ORIGINAL pushed terms (kept in
/// `prev_terms`), never a dictionary reconstruction, so the live graph receives
/// the same insert/delete SETS as before the substrate adoption. Pinned by the
/// four-EvalMode cross-check tests and the SRBench expressivity ratchet.
///
/// ## Monomorphic (no dynamic dispatch)
///
/// The probe path carries no trait object: `NoBudget` is a zero-sized generic
/// `Budget`, the emit hook is a monomorphised closure, and the key projection
/// is plain `Id = u32` column data — `scripts/check-no-dyn-dispatch.py` guards
/// this file structurally (the #1303 invariant, consumer side of the seam).
///
/// ## Memory bound
///
/// `dict` grows monotonically with the stream's all-time vocabulary — the SAME
/// documented bound as the live graph's own dictionary in these two modes. It
/// is deliberately SEPARATE from the live graph's dict so the graph's
/// id-assignment order (and thus its observable behaviour) is untouched by the
