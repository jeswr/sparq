//! The stream model: application-timestamped triples and a push builder.

//! Timestamps are **application-supplied** `u64`s (logical ticks, epoch millis,
//! sequence numbers — the engine does not care, and it NEVER reads the wall
//! clock). Window assignment, closure and lateness are therefore pure functions
//! of the pushed `(triple, ts)` sequence: deterministic and unit-testable.
