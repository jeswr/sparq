//! [SONNET-4.6] sq-2n1q3.5: substrate-join adoption analysis — REASONED NON-ADOPTION
//! (see the "Substrate join: why it does not apply here" section below).
//!
//! [`ContinuousQuery`](crate::ContinuousQuery) is *one stream, one window, one
//! query*. RSP-QL allows a query to open SEVERAL named windows — possibly over
//! different streams, possibly with different `RANGE`/`STEP` — and JOIN across
//! them in the `WHERE` (`WINDOW <w1> { … } WINDOW <w2> { … }`, sharing
//! variables). [`ContinuousMultiQuery`] is that form.
//!
//! # How the join is evaluated
//!
//! Each declared window keeps its OWN S2R state — a
//! [`WindowedStream`](crate::WindowedStream) over the stream it reads. A push
//! `(stream, triple, ts)` is routed to every window declared `ON` that stream;
//! a stream feeding two windows feeds both, independently. All windows share ONE
//! event-time clock (the maximum timestamp seen across all streams), so closure
//! is synchronized: a triple on stream `s1` advancing the clock can close a
//! window on stream `s2`. This is the deterministic Window-Close report policy —
//! the same watermark contract the single-window pipeline already pins.
//!
//! At each EVALUATION TICK — a synchronized boundary at which at least one window
//! closes — every window contributes its current closed content as a NAMED GRAPH
//! keyed by the window IRI. The windows are assembled into a single
//! [`sparq_core::Graph`] (empty default graph, one named sub-graph per window),
//! and the registered query — with each `WINDOW <w>` rewritten to a standard
//! SPARQL `GRAPH <w>` — is evaluated against it. The engine's `GRAPH <w> { … }`
//! evaluation translates each window's ids into the shared outer dictionary, so
//! a variable bound in `WINDOW <w1>` JOINS correctly with the same variable in
//! `WINDOW <w2>` (the cross-graph join the engine already supports — see
//! `eval_graph_named`). The full result is delivered as a [`WindowResult`].
//!
//! ## Tick alignment (the synchronization rule)
//!
//! Windows may close at different times (different `STEP`s). The join is
//! evaluated **once per distinct closing boundary**, oldest first; at boundary
//! `t` each window contributes the content of its window that closed AT or
//! IMMEDIATELY BEFORE `t` (its latest-closed content), so a slow window's
//! content is held steady across the faster window's ticks. A window that has
//! not closed any content yet (no triples within reach of the watermark)
//! contributes the empty graph — `GRAPH <w> { … }` then yields no rows, so the
//! join correctly produces nothing until every joined window has content.
//!
//! ## 3+-window joins ([SONNET-4.6] sq-2n1q3.3)
//!
//! The `windows` field is a `Vec<WindowState>` so `ContinuousMultiQuery` handles
//! two, three, or any number of named windows identically: each window gets its
//! own S2R state, all share the same synchronized clock, and the named-graph
//! materialization loop over `self.windows` naturally scales. The `register` API
//! enforces ≥ 2 windows (use `ContinuousQuery` for one); three or more require
//! no additional code.
//!
//! ## ISTREAM/DSTREAM over a multi-window join ([SONNET-4.6] sq-2n1q3.3)
//!
//! At each tick the FULL join result is computed first; when the `R2S` operator
//! is `ISTREAM` or `DSTREAM` the diff against the previous tick's full result
//! is applied (reusing `crate::query::diff_rows`). The diff base advances after
//! every tick, exactly as in `ContinuousQuery`.
//!
//! * **ISTREAM** — each tick emits the rows that APPEARED relative to the
//!   previous tick (`cur ∖ prev`, exact term-level multiset difference).
//! * **DSTREAM** — each tick emits the rows that DISAPPEARED (`prev ∖ cur`).
//!
//! The `REGISTER ISTREAM <out> AS` / `REGISTER DSTREAM <out> AS` RSP-QL header
//! form selects the operator; the programmatic `r2s` field is read from the
//! parsed header.
//!
//! ## Substrate join: why it does not apply here (sq-2n1q3.5 analysis)
//!
//! [SONNET-4.6] sq-2n1q3.5 investigated whether the cross-window join in
//! `eval_tick` / `materialize_named` should adopt
//! `sparq_substrate::join::delta::DeltaTable` (the semi-naive probe kernel), as
//! `eval.rs` did for its consecutive-window diff in sq-2n1q3.4.
//!
//! **Conclusion: reasoned non-adoption.** The substrate kernels are not
//! applicable to this join surface for the following reasons:
//!
//! 1. **The engine already uses the substrate internally.** The cross-window
//!    join is a general SPARQL `GRAPH <w1> { } GRAPH <w2> { }` pattern;
//!    `sparq_engine::query_prepared` evaluates it via the engine's own
//!    bind-join / hash-join paths, which already drive the substrate kernels
//!    internally. There is no substrate bypass in this path.
//!
//! 2. **Different problem shape.** `eval.rs` adopted the substrate to replace
//!    a per-slide term-level hash-set diff between CONSECUTIVE windows of a
//!    SINGLE stream (the INSERT/DELETE membership test). That is a triple-level
//!    set-membership operation with a persistent `DeltaTable` build side. The
//!    cross-window join here is a full multi-graph SPARQL evaluation: arbitrary
//!    query shape (filters, aggregates, OPTIONAL, UNION, aggregates), N windows,
//!    variable bindings flowing across `GRAPH` patterns. No persistent build
//!    side is applicable — each tick's named-graph assembly is fresh.
//!
//! 3. **Key projection is inaccessible without planner integration.** Using the
//!    substrate for the cross-window join directly would require extracting the
//!    variable-to-column layout from the prepared query's algebra — information
//!    that lives in the engine's private `Bindings`/`LocalVocab` layer and
//!    cannot be computed here without coupling to engine internals. The engine
//!    seam (`research/shared-eval-substrate.md` §2.3) deliberately keeps that
//!    projection private.
//!
//! 4. **Correct incremental evaluation is a planner change, not a multi.rs
//!    change.** A genuinely incremental multi-window join (semi-naive evaluation
//!    at the SPARQL algebra level, only re-evaluating the sub-patterns whose
//!    window's content changed at this tick) would be a new feature of the query
//!    planner, not a drop-in replacement in this module. That is a different
//!    bead and a larger, non-behaviour-neutral scope.
//!
//! This non-adoption is therefore correct and sound: `multi.rs` continues to
//! delegate the cross-window join to `sparq_engine::query_prepared` which
//! drives the substrate through the engine's planned algebra. The RSP
//! expressivity / SRBench correctness ratchet (`tests/srbench_oracle.rs`) is
//! byte-identical before and after this analysis.
//!
//! ## Scope (honest)
//!
//! * Time windows only (the surface grammar has no `ROWS`).
//! * The `output_stream` / entailment metadata parsed by `RspqlQuery` is
//!   retained but not acted on (this is a library, not a stream-router).
