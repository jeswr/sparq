//! Categorical **codebook** encoder for enumeration members (structure-aware vectorisation **P2**).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-0wo9e.3 (epic sq-0wo9e; design `research/structure-aware-vectorisation.md`
//! §2 row "`owl:oneOf` / `sh:in` enum → a CATEGORICAL CODEBOOK" + §6.A "enum / boolean exactness").
//! The encoder for [`crate::encode::Encoder::Enum`]. It is **opt-in** (the `structure` cargo
//! feature, off by default — pure, no new dependency) and changes **nothing** in the default
//! `sparq-vectors` build or the core engine.
//!
//! # The provable invariant — enum equality is a SLOT MATCH, not a cosine threshold
//!
//! An enumeration declared by `sh:in (…)` or `owl:oneOf (…)` is a **closed set** of members. The
//! codebook reserves **one dimension per member** plus a **single reserved dimension for the
//! out-of-enum / invalid code** (slot `0`). Encoding sets exactly one slot to `1.0`:
//!
//! - a member sets its own member slot → membership is decided by **which slot is hot**, an exact
//!   equality, **never a cosine threshold** (design §2: "no recall loss");
//! - a value **not in the enum** sets the reserved invalid slot (`0`) → it is a *distinct, reserved
//!   code* a closed-world SHACL `sh:in` shape rejects (design §2: "out-of-enum → reserved invalid
//!   code SHACL rejects"), never silently collapsed onto a member.
//!
//! [`Codebook::encode`] / [`Codebook::decode`] **round-trip** every member and the invalid code
//! (the `encode_decode_roundtrip` test is the gate). The block is one-hot non-negative, so it is correct
//! under L2/cosine and tagged [`Metric::Euclidean`](crate::encode::Metric::Euclidean).
//!
//! # What is NOT claimed
//!
//! No embedding-quality claim. A learned codebook (rather than one-hot) is a future variant; the
//! one-hot form is the *provable* baseline (exact membership), and whether a learned codebook lifts
//! downstream retrieval is empirical and ablation-gated (design §6.B). The width grows with the
//! enum size, so this is intended for **small, closed** enumerations (the common `sh:in` case).
