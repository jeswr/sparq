//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-32i5) A cheap, strongly-distinguishing **graph fingerprint** embedded in
//! the `.spqv` / `.spqg` headers so a stale store can never silently return WRONG results.
//!
//! # The foot-gun this closes
//!
//! A [`VectorStore`](crate::store::VectorStore) (`.spqv`) and a
//! [`DiskAnnIndex`](crate::diskann::DiskAnnIndex) (`.spqg`) are build-once-immutable and keyed by
//! **dictionary term id**. They carry no link to the graph they were built against. But a graph
//! mutation/rebuild can SHIFT dict ids (interning order changes), and a query entry point such as
//! [`nearest_term`](crate::diskann::DiskAnnIndex::nearest_term) resolves the query term through the
//! *caller-provided* graph's dictionary (`graph.id_of(term)`) and then looks that id up in the
//! store. If the store was built against a different generation of the graph, the id resolves to a
//! DIFFERENT term's vector — and the search returns plausible-looking but WRONG neighbours, with no
//! error. This module makes that mismatch a hard, descriptive error instead.
//!
//! # What is fingerprinted (the exact inputs — keep this comment in sync with [`Fingerprint::of`])
//!
//! Three fields, all cheap to compute at build time and on open:
//!   1. **`dict_len`** — `graph.dict.len()`, the number of real dictionary terms. O(1).
//!   2. **`triple_count`** — `graph.len()`, the number of triples in the default graph. O(1).
//!   3. **`content_hash`** — a 64-bit hash over **the dictionary term SET, folded in a
//!      dict-id-order-INDEPENDENT order** (sorted), not in id order. For each real term we
//!      compute a per-term 64-bit content hash from its *lexical* content (its [`TermParts`] — IRI
//!      prefix+suffix, literal value+datatype+lang, blank label, or — for a triple term — its three
//!      children resolved RECURSIVELY to their own lexical content rather than to their raw child
//!      ids). The per-term hashes are then **sorted** and folded in that canonical order, so the
//!      result is a function of *which terms are present*, not of *which id each landed on*. The two
//!      scalars are folded in first so a fingerprint that agrees on the hash but differs on
//!      length/count is still rejected. `FxHasher` is used because it is **deterministic with no
//!      seed** (the same property the core dictionary relies on for its own content hashing), so a
//!      fingerprint computed at build time on one machine matches one recomputed at open time on
//!      another. [OPUS-4.8] (sq-32i5) Every hashed input is **fixed-width** — lengths/counts as
//!      `u64`, ids as `u32`, tags as `u8`, never `usize` — so the folded byte sequence (and thus
//!      the hash) is identical on 32-bit wasm32 and 64-bit native; the cross-machine guarantee
//!      holds by construction. The cost is O(dict_len) to hash each term plus one
//!      O(dict_len·log dict_len) sort over already-resident term parts — a small fraction of the
//!      embed/build work that produced the store in the first place.
//!
//! # [OPUS-4.8] (sq-xhiv) Why the fold is dict-id-order-INDEPENDENT
//!
//! `sparq-core` assigns dictionary ids in a **thread-count-dependent** order: the parallel sharded
//! dict merge sizes its shard count from `rayon::current_num_threads()`, so the *same* logical graph
//! re-loaded from the *same* source RDF at a different thread count gets a different (still internally
//! consistent) id→term binding. An earlier version of this fingerprint folded every term *in ascending
//! id order, binding the id explicitly* — which made it spuriously MISMATCH a store against a graph
//! that was merely re-loaded at a different `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`, even though the graph is logically
//! identical (the failure was **fail-closed** — a descriptive error, never wrong vectors). The whole
//! point of the fingerprint is to catch a graph that genuinely *changed* (a term added/removed/edited
//! ⇒ wrong vectors keyed by the shifted ids), not a thread-count-driven id permutation of an unchanged
//! term set. Folding the term *set* in a sorted (id-order-independent) order detects exactly the
//! former and is invariant to the latter, so the same graph fingerprints identically at any thread
//! count (the regression test `fingerprint_stable_across_thread_counts` pins this), while a real term
//! change still changes the hash. See `research/dict-id-order-determinism-audit.md` (sq-xom2).
//!
//! `content_hash` is a **collision-resistance-irrelevant integrity check**, not a security MAC: it
//! exists to catch accidental staleness, not to defend against an adversary crafting a colliding
//! graph (it makes no integrity, soundness, or tamper-resistance claim against a motivated party).
//! dict_len + triple_count are folded alongside it precisely so the common shift cases
//! (terms added/removed, triples added/removed) are caught structurally even before the hash.
//!
//! # [OPUS-4.8] (sq-wlzi) The id-keyed STALENESS CONTRACT — serve via `Graph::open`, never a re-parse
//!
//! A passing [`check_against`] is **necessary but NOT sufficient** for a correct query, and the
//! sq-xhiv thread-count-stability above is exactly why. The store/index are keyed by **raw dict id**;
//! the fingerprint deliberately folds only the term *set*, so it is **blind to a pure id permutation
//! of an unchanged term set**. That blindness is the right call for the fingerprint's job (catch a
//! genuine term change, ignore a thread-count reshuffle), but it means the fingerprint **cannot** tell
//! a graph with the build-time `id → term` binding apart from the *same* graph re-parsed at a different
//! `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` (whose ids permuted). Both fingerprint identically, so `check_against` passes
//! BOTH — yet only the first resolves the id-keyed store correctly; the re-parse serves a **different,
//! real term's vector** under the queried term's id (a plausible-looking but WRONG neighbour, no error).
//!
//! The CONTRACT that closes this gap is a **usage discipline**, not a code check:
//!
//! > To serve a persisted `.spqv` / `.spqg`, **persist the graph it was built against**
//! > (`Graph::save`) and **reopen THAT graph** (`Graph::open`, which mmaps the **frozen** dict id
//! > order) to resolve query terms. **NEVER re-parse the source RDF** (`Graph::load_str` /
//! > `load_reader` / `load_dataset`): the parallel sharded dict merge assigns thread-count-dependent
//! > ids, so a re-parse yields a different `id → term` binding than the store was keyed against. (The
//! > `mmap` feature on `sparq-core` gates `Graph::save`/`Graph::open`.)
//!
//! An id-keyed store/index is valid ONLY against the **exact graph generation it was built against**.
//! The persisted dict is the only thread-count-independent id binding sparq-core exposes, so reopening
//! it is the only sound way to recover that generation. `check_against` remains a worthwhile guard for
//! the cases it *can* catch (a term added/removed/edited ⇒ a changed term set ⇒ a changed fingerprint),
//! but it is a backstop, not the primary safety mechanism — the discipline above is. The round-trip
//! and the re-parse trap are pinned end-to-end in `tests/staleness_contract.rs`. A larger, optional
//! redesign that would make a *logically*-identical graph queryable at any thread count — re-resolving
//! neighbours by **term** rather than raw id (a term-keyed store/index/mask) — is tracked as a separate
//! follow-up (it changes the on-disk format and the `IdMask` mask-cache key; not a doc change).
