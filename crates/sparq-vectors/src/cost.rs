//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-7hx6, epic sq-3183) **Filtered-ANN pre-filter vs post-filter cost model** —
//! deciding when materialising a transitive [`IdMask`] and pre-filtering
//! the search is worth it, versus running the search unfiltered and dropping the disallowed hits
//! afterwards.
//!
//! This is the cost concern recorded as sq-ic0n ("when transitive masking pays"); sq-7hx6 IS that
//! cost model, so sq-ic0n is **subsumed** by this module.
//!
//! # The two strategies (and why they return the same answer)
//!
//! For a `vec:` neighbour variable constrained by a sub-BGP, the *answer* is unambiguous: the
//! top-`k` stored vectors **whose id is admitted by the constraint**, ranked by cosine. There are
//! two ways to compute it, and — this is the load-bearing invariant — **they return byte-identical
//! results** (same ids, same order; cosine ties break on ascending id in both):
//!
//! - **Pre-filter** ([`crate::filter::nearest_exact_filtered`]): scan only the masked ids and rank
//!   them. Work ≈ `|mask| · dim` distance computations. This is what the `vec:` rewrite has always
//!   done once a mask is derived.
//!
//! - **Post-filter** ([`postfilter_exact`]): run the *unfiltered* exact scan over the whole store
//!   (already a full sort by cosine), then walk that ranking dropping ids not in the mask until `k`
//!   admitted hits are collected. Work ≈ `store_len · dim` distance computations (the full scan)
//!   regardless of selectivity.
//!
//! Because the unfiltered scan is a *complete* ranking of the store, post-filtering it can never
//! under-fill `k` unless the mask itself admits fewer than `k` stored-and-embedded vectors — in
//! which case **both** strategies return the same short list (the pre-filter scan of the mask is
//! also short). So there is no over-fetch recall boundary for the exact-scan backend: post-filter
//! over a full ranking is answer-complete by construction. (The over-fetch *boundary* only bites an
//! **approximate** index that returns a bounded candidate list; see [`overfetch_target`] and the
//! honest caveat there — that path is a documented follow-up, not the exact backend used here.)
//!
//! # The cost the mask itself carries
//!
//! Both strategies still need to know *which* ids are admitted, but they pay for it differently.
//! Pre-filter **must** materialise the full mask (it scans it). Post-filter only needs *membership*
//! — and crucially, deriving the mask through the engine (a full SELECT over the sub-BGP, in the
//! `vec:` rewrite under the `vec-predicate` feature) costs roughly the sub-BGP's cardinality `c`
//! regardless. So the model's job is
//! NOT "mask vs no mask" (we derive the mask either way to stay answer-safe); it is **"having a mask,
//! is it cheaper to scan the mask (pre-filter) or scan the whole store and drop non-members
//! (post-filter)?"** — i.e. is `|mask| · dim` (plus the mask's hash-set build) below `store_len · dim`
//! by enough to be worth the worse cache behaviour of gathering scattered masked rows?
//!
//! # The heuristic (NOT optimal — estimates only)
//!
//! Let `m = |mask|`, `n = store_len`. Pre-filter touches `m` rows, post-filter touches `n`. Pre-filter
//! gathers *scattered* rows (random-access into the mmap) whereas post-filter streams the store
//! sequentially, so a masked row is modelled as `scatter_penalty ×` (default `2.0`) the cost of a
//! sequential row. **Pre-filter is chosen when**
//!
//! ```text
//!     m · scatter_penalty  ≤  n
//! ```
//!
//! i.e. when the mask is selective enough that even at the scatter penalty, scanning it beats a full
//! sequential scan. With the default penalty that is `m ≤ n / 2` — pre-filter for a mask admitting up
//! to half the store, post-filter for a broader one. `k` and `dim` cancel out of the *exact-scan*
//! comparison (both strategies do `dim`-width distance work per touched row and both then take `k`),
//! so they do not enter this crossover; they are surfaced in [`CostEstimate`] for callers wiring an
//! approximate backend (where `k`/over-fetch *do* matter) and to keep the estimate honest about what
//! it did and did not model.
//!
//! This is a **heuristic over a cost *estimate***, not a proven optimum: `scatter_penalty` is a
//! single modelled constant, real cache/SIMD behaviour is hardware-dependent, and the sub-BGP
//! cardinality is the *materialised* mask size (exact here, but an estimate in a planner that has not
//! evaluated it). The one thing it is NOT allowed to get wrong is the **answer**: whichever branch it
//! picks, the returned top-`k` is identical (asserted in the tests), so a mis-estimate costs only
//! throughput, never correctness.
