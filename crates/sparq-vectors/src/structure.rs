//! Structure-aware vectorisation **preprocessing + sampling-logic** layer (P0).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-0wo9e.1 (epic sq-0wo9e; design `research/structure-aware-vectorisation.md`
//! §5.A + §2 row "domain/range"). This module is the **lowest-risk, additive** slice of the
//! structure-aware-vectorisation epic. It is **opt-in** (the `structure` cargo feature, off by
//! default) and changes **nothing** in the default `sparq-vectors` build or the core engine.
//!
//! # What this is — and, honestly, what it is NOT
//!
//! `sparq-vectors` is a vector-**search** + **import** surface: embeddings are produced
//! **out-of-process** (see [`crate::embed`]) and the crate has **no KGE training path** — no
//! TransE / ComplEx / RotatE, no triple-scoring, no learning loop, no negative-sampling consumer.
//! P0 of the design ("restrict KGE *corruptions* to type-valid entities") therefore presupposes a
//! trainer that does not exist in-tree. Rather than build a large new training subsystem blind
//! (the design review #996 may reshape it), this module ships the two **buildable, additive**
//! halves of P0 as reusable primitives an out-of-process trainer (or a future in-tree KGE block)
//! consumes:
//!
//! 1. **closure-before-vectorise** ([`close_for_vectorise`] / [`materialise_closure`]) — run the
//!    `sparq-reason` closure ([`Profile::Rdfs`] or [`Profile::OwlRl`]) over the graph **before** the
//!    vectoriser sees it, so entailed type / `subClassOf` / domain / range triples are *materialised
//!    facts* the encoder, the type extractor, and the negative sampler all read.
//! 2. **type-constrained negative sampling** ([`TypeConstraints`] + [`NegativeSampler`]) — the
//!    established Krompass et al. 2015 technique: corrupt a positive triple's head only to
//!    entities whose type lies in the predicate's **domain**, its tail only to entities in the
//!    predicate's **range**. The constraints are read from `sparq-introspect` (declared
//!    `rdfs:domain`/`rdfs:range` **and** observed domain/range histograms) over the **closed**
//!    graph.
//!
//! The KGE trainer that *consumes* these negatives is the deferred remainder (bead noted in the
//! crate README / SKILL). This module trains nothing and serves no exact answer.
//!
//! # The on/off ablation hook (load-bearing, design §6.B)
//!
//! Every prior in this epic ships **behind an on/off ablation** and is adopted **only on measured
//! lift** — no accuracy claim is made in advance. [`SamplingMode`] is that switch:
//! [`SamplingMode::Unconstrained`] reproduces vanilla uniform corruption; [`SamplingMode::TypeConstrained`]
//! applies the domain/range restriction. A harness runs the *same* sampler in both modes and
//! compares Hits@k / MRR downstream. **No benchmark numbers exist; none are claimed here.**
