//! [FABLE-5] (#2251) **Recall-gated ANN over raw concept vectors**: `build_ann` / `knn` /
//! `dedup` — an HNSW-class index over caller-supplied `(id, vector)` pairs (no
//! [`VectorStore`](crate::VectorStore) required), plus **recall-gated type-level
//! deduplication**: near-duplicate merges are computed from approximate nearest-neighbour
//! results, but are **applied only after** the index's measured recall against a
//! caller-supplied **exact O(m²) ground truth** clears a pre-registered gate (default
//! `0.99`). Below the gate, [`dedup`] returns `Err` and **no merge is emitted** — the gate
//! fails closed.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** Exact all-pairs dedup is O(m²) and dies past a few hundred
//! thousand vectors; ANN scales but is approximate (recall `< 1.0`). The contract here is
//! the honest middle: the consumer builds one exact ground truth at a rung where O(m²) is
//! still tractable (e.g. 100k), and every ANN-driven merge pass first proves — on that
//! ground truth — that the index recalls at least the gated fraction of true neighbours.
//! The gate is **evidence on the measured dataset**, not a universal recall guarantee: a
//! different corpus, dimension, or policy needs its own ground truth. The first consumer
//! is the Kernel-of-Truth scale track (cross-source concept dedup at the 100k → millions
//! rungs; sparq issue #2251).
//!
//! Similarity is **cosine** throughout, exactly as the rest of this crate: vectors are
//! L2-normalised into the graph and searched with Euclidean distance (rank-equivalent on
//! unit vectors, `cos = 1 − d²/2`), so scores are directly comparable to
//! [`nearest_exact`](crate::nearest_exact) / [`VectorIndex`](crate::VectorIndex).
//!
//! `approx-ann` only — this module rides the same opt-in `instant-distance` HNSW backend
//! as [`VectorIndex`](crate::VectorIndex), so the default build carries none of it.
