//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-ip3a, epic sq-3183; follow-up to sq-7hx6) **Pluggable ANN backend seam +
//! iterative over-fetch for the FILTERED approximate path.**
//!
//! sq-7hx6 ([`crate::cost`]) settled the *exact*-scan filtered story: post-filtering a **complete**
//! cosine ranking can never under-fill `k` (it sees every admitted vector), so there is no
//! over-fetch boundary for the exact backend. This module is where the **approximate** backend
//! bites — and it bites exactly as sq-7hx6's [`overfetch_target`]
//! docs warned it would.
//!
//! # The backend trait
//!
//! [`AnnBackend`] is the seam the filtered path searches *through*: a backend returns a ranked
//! `(Id, cosine)` candidate list of a requested `fetch` size, best-first. Two impls:
//!
//! - **[`ExactBackend`]** (default, no third-party dep) — wraps `nearest_exact`. `fetch` ≥ the
//!   store size yields the *complete* ranking, so it is **answer-exact**; recall is `1.0`.
//! - **[`ApproxBackend`]** (`approx-ann`, wraps the on-disk `DiskAnnIndex` Vamana graph; the
//!   in-RAM HNSW [`VectorIndex`](crate::VectorIndex) is an equally valid impl) — returns a
//!   *bounded, approximate* candidate list. Recall is **`< 1.0`** by construction: an approximate
//!   index can miss true neighbours. We never claim exactness for it; the recall floor is a
//!   *measured* test assertion (see `tests/overfetch.rs`), not a guarantee.
//!
//! # Why the FILTERED approximate path needs iterative over-fetch
//!
//! Post-filtering a *bounded* approximate candidate list can **under-fill `k`**: if the top
//! `fetch` candidates contain fewer than `k` ids the mask admits, the result is short even though
//! the store holds `≥ k` admitted vectors. [`overfetch_target`]
//! sizes a *first* fetch at `ceil(k / selectivity)` — enough *on average* — but the admitted ids
//! can cluster *below* that prefix, so a single sized fetch still under-fills (the recall boundary
//! sq-7hx6 documented).
//!
//! [`nearest_filtered_overfetch`] removes that boundary the honest way: fetch
//! `overfetch_target(k, …)`, post-filter, and **if fewer than `k` survive, grow the fetch
//! (doubling) and retry** — up to the store size or a probe bound. When the fetch reaches the
//! store size the candidate list is complete *for that backend*, so a still-short result means the
//! mask genuinely admits `< k` vectors (the correct short answer), NOT an over-fetch artefact.
//!
//! # Honesty about recall (the load-bearing caveat)
//!
//! Iterative over-fetch fixes **under-fill** (returning fewer than `k` when `k` exist); it does
//! **not** make an approximate backend exact. Even a full-store fetch from [`ApproxBackend`] is the
//! *approximate* ranking, so a true top-`k` admitted neighbour the index never visits is still
//! missed: **recall stays `< 1.0`**. Only [`ExactBackend`] is answer-exact. The A1-paper recall
//! evidence is for the exact / transitive answer-safe path (sq-7hx6); it does **not** transfer to
//! this approximate path — keep the distinction. The honest contract here is: "fill `k` whenever
//! `k` admitted vectors exist *and the backend surfaces them*, with a measured recall floor", not
//! "return the exact filtered top-`k`".
