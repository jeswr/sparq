//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-1wc1) **Predicate-constrained (filtered) ANN** — the RDF-native vector
//! differentiator.
//!
//! A SPARQL basic graph pattern constrains *which* graph nodes are eligible neighbours
//! (e.g. `?node a :Car ; :seats ?s` carves out a candidate id-set), and the nearest-neighbour
//! search must return only neighbours **within that set**. The caller (engine / `vec:` rewrite)
//! computes the exact set of permitted dictionary ids from the BGP through the permutation
//! indexes; this module's job is to *accept that set as a mask and honour it* during search.
//!
//! # The mask
//!
//! [`IdMask`] is a set of permitted dictionary [`Id`]s — the "visit mask" of allowed neighbours.
//! It is deliberately a plain id set (backed by [`rustc_hash::FxHashSet`], already a crate dep),
//! so building one is just `BGP-result-ids.collect()`; no new dependency enters the tree and the
//! feature stays lean. Membership is the only operation search needs.
//!
//! # Two strategies (selectivity decides)
//!
//! Both strategies return **exactly** the same neighbours an exact full scan restricted to the
//! mask would — but cost differently as the mask's selectivity changes:
//!
//! - **Pre-filter** ([`nearest_exact_filtered`]): scan only the masked ids and rank them by
//!   cosine. Cost is O(|mask|·dim). When the mask is **very selective** (few eligible nodes) this
//!   is both *exact* and *cheapest* — touching the whole ANN graph to find a handful of accepted
//!   nodes would be wasteful, and a filtered graph traversal can even fail to reach an isolated
//!   accepted node through unaccepted hops.
//!
//! - **Filtered traversal** ([`DiskAnnIndex::nearest_filtered`], ACORN / NaviX-style): walk the
//!   Vamana proximity graph **predicate-agnostically** — expand through *every* neighbour for
//!   connectivity — but **only accept** (collect into the result) nodes that are in the mask
//!   (*predicate-aware acceptance*). This keeps the graph's short search paths while filtering the
//!   output, and is the right choice when the mask is broad (a large fraction of the store passes),
//!   where pre-filtering would scan almost everything.
//!
//! The crossover is governed by a **selectivity threshold** (see [`FilterConfig`]): below it the
//! mask is "selective" and we pre-filter; above it we traverse. The default
//! ([`FilterConfig::default`]) pre-filters when the mask admits **≤ 1%** of the store *or* ≤ 256
//! nodes (whichever is larger), an honestly conservative line — pre-filter is exact, so erring
//! toward it never hurts recall, only (mildly) throughput on a mid-selective mask. Callers that
//! know their workload can move the line with [`FilterConfig`].
//!
//! Filtered traversal over an approximate graph is itself approximate: a target accepted node can
//! sit behind a region the beam prunes. [`DiskAnnIndex::nearest_filtered`] therefore widens its
//! own search beam (it must visit more nodes to *accept* `k`), and the
//! [`tests`](../tests/filtered.rs) measure recall against the exact-filtered ground truth.
//!
//! # Why the on-disk Vamana index and not the HNSW one
//!
//! Filtered traversal needs the graph's **adjacency** to walk it. [`DiskAnnIndex`] owns its
//! on-disk Vamana adjacency, so filtered traversal lives there. [`crate::ann::VectorIndex`] wraps
//! `instant-distance`, whose adjacency is **not exposed**, so it cannot do predicate-agnostic
//! traversal — for it (and as a universal fallback) [`nearest_exact_filtered`] is the filtered
//! path. This mirrors the crate's existing split: `VectorIndex` is the in-RAM convenience, the
//! on-disk graph is where the index internals are ours to extend.
