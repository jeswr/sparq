//! Neuro-symbolic **propose(neural)-then-verify(deductive)** grounding pipeline
//! (structure-aware vectorisation **P5**).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-0wo9e.6 (epic sq-0wo9e; design `research/structure-aware-vectorisation.md`
//! §5 (B) "Neuro-symbolic propose-then-verify" + §6.A "Verify-soundness / answer-safety").
//! This module is the **fifth** additive slice of the structure-aware-vectorisation epic, on top
//! of P0 ([`crate::structure`]: closure-before-vectorise + type-constrained negatives) and P4
//! ([`crate::grounding`]: the flexible grounding selector). It is **opt-in** (the
//! `neuro-symbolic` cargo feature, off by default) and changes **nothing** in the default
//! `sparq-vectors` build or the core engine.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! Grounding a tool slot `(subject, predicate, ?)` against a graph has two halves with
//! **deliberately asymmetric guarantees**, and this module keeps them honestly separate:
//!
//! 1. **PROPOSE (neural / vector — a candidate GENERATOR, recall only).** The structure-aware
//!    entity vectors propose high-recall candidate objects for the slot by vector similarity
//!    ([`propose_by_vector`], an exact-ANN scan of [`crate::ann::nearest_exact`] over the
//!    `.spqv` store). **This step has NO soundness or completeness guarantee** — it is a
//!    generator that may surface a candidate that is *type-inconsistent*, violates a *shape
//!    constraint*, or uses a *predicate invalid for the subject's type*. It is framed that way
//!    on purpose: a vector neighbour is a *hypothesis*, never a verified fact.
//! 2. **VERIFY (deductive / constraint — the soundness GATE).** Each proposed candidate is
//!    checked deductively ([`verify_candidate`]): the candidate binding `(subject, predicate,
//!    object)` is added to the graph and the result must (a) introduce **no new SHACL violation**
//!    on the affected focus nodes (`sparq-shacl`; datatype / cardinality / enum / `sh:class` /
//!    node-kind conformance) **and** (b) introduce **no new OWL inconsistency** — a disjoint /
//!    complement class clash, a `differentFrom`/`sameAs` clash, a max-cardinality-0 violation
//!    (`sparq-reason::inconsistencies`, the `cax-dw` / `cax-adc` / `prp-*` clash rules over the
//!    materialised closure). **A candidate that fails EITHER check is REJECTED — not merely
//!    down-ranked.**
//!
//! The returned set is therefore the **deductively-verified subset** of what the neural side
//! proposed: the pipeline can only ever *shrink* the candidate set toward a sound subset
//! (design §5: "the candidate set can only SHRINK to a sound subset"), generalising the
//! existing "ANN proposes, exact engine re-validates" invariant to SHACL + closure verification.
//!
//! # Soundness contract (load-bearing — design §6.A "Verify-soundness / answer-safety")
//!
//! - **The verify is a real DEDUCTIVE GATE, not a re-ranker.** A vector-proposed candidate that
//!   fails the shape/type/disjointness check is dropped from the output. [`verify_candidate`]
//!   returns a [`Verdict`] whose [`Verdict::is_verified`] is the **only** thing
//!   [`propose_then_verify`] surfaces as a grounding; a rejected candidate never appears.
//! - **FAIL-CLOSED.** When the deductive check *cannot be run to a clean conclusion* — e.g. the
//!   candidate id is not a real dictionary term, or building the augmented graph fails — the
//!   candidate is **rejected**, never surfaced as verified. The honest default is "unproven ⇒
//!   not surfaced", never "unproven ⇒ assume valid".
//! - **The neural step is NOT claimed sound.** [`propose_by_vector`] is documented and typed as a
//!   recall-oriented generator. No part of this module asserts the vector similarity is correct;
//!   correctness comes *only* from the deductive gate.
//!
//! # What is provable vs benchmarked (stated up front, honestly)
//!
//! - **Provable (and tested):** *verify-shrinks-to-sound* — every candidate in
//!   [`VerifyReport::verified`] is a subset of the proposed set **and** introduces no new SHACL
//!   violation / OWL inconsistency relative to the base graph. The load-bearing test asserts a
//!   vector-proposed-but-shape-invalid candidate is **rejected**.
//! - **Benchmarked-only (NOT claimed here):** whether the neural propose step actually raises
//!   end-task *recall* over a non-vector generator is **empirical and dataset-dependent**
//!   (GraphRAG/KG-RAG does not uniformly beat vector RAG — design §5 honesty line). The
//!   on/off-ablation harness ([`crate::eval`], sq-0wo9e.7) is where that is measured; **no
//!   accuracy number is asserted in this module or its docs.**
