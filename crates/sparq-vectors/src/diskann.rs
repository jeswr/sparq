//! [OPUS-4.8] A **persistent, on-disk Vamana ANN index** (`.spqg`) over a [`VectorStore`]:
//! a fixed-degree proximity graph laid out for memory-mapped, locality-friendly reads, so a
//! built index is **saved once and reopened without a rebuild** (the gap [`ann`](crate::ann)'s
//! in-RAM HNSW left — see that module's persistence note and this crate's open beads
//! (`bd list -l area:sparq-vectors`)).
//!
//! # Why a second index
//!
//! `VectorIndex` wraps `instant-distance`'s HNSW, which is rebuilt
//! from the mmap'd store on every open (~33 s release for 50k×32 on an M1 — see the README
//! throughput table). `instant-distance` is a closed graph: its adjacency is not exposed, so
//! it cannot be laid out on disk. This index is therefore **self-contained** — we build the
//! Vamana graph ourselves and own its on-disk encoding end to end.
//!
//! # Algorithm (Vamana, the DiskANN graph)
//!
//! Build (in RAM, once): start from a random `R`-regular graph, then for each node run a
//! greedy search from a fixed medoid to collect visited candidates and `RobustPrune` them to
//! at most `R` out-neighbours (the α-pruned edge set that gives DiskANN its short search
//! paths); edges are made undirected and re-pruned when a node exceeds degree `R`. Two passes
//! (α = 1.0 then α = `alpha`) per the DiskANN paper. Search: greedy beam search of width `L`
//! from the medoid. Distance is **cosine**, identical to [`ann`](crate::ann): vectors are
//! L2-normalized at build time and Euclidean-on-unit-vectors is rank-equivalent to cosine
//! (`cos = 1 − d²/2`), so reported scores and rankings match the exact/HNSW searchers.
//!
//! # On-disk format (`.spqg`, version 2, little-endian)

//!   nbrs      [R] u32              neighbour SLOT indices; entries ≥ degree are padding
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-qamd) the optional PQ_SECTION (present iff enc_tag == 1, appended after nodes):

//!   codes     [count × M] bytes    per-slot PQ codes, slot order (== node-record order)
//! ```
//!
//! A node's vector and its adjacency are **co-located in one record** (the DiskANN locality
//! property): one contiguous read per visited node — the OS pages in a record and gets both
//! the distance input and the next hops, no scatter. Records start at multiples of 4 from the
//! page-aligned map, so the `f32` cast is always aligned (same discipline as `.spqv`).
//!
//! # Honest scope vs. full DiskANN
//!
//! The default build is the **Vamana on-disk graph with full-precision vectors searched from the
//! mmap**. Full DiskANN additionally keeps a **PQ-compressed** copy of every vector resident in RAM
//! to rank candidates without touching disk, reading full-precision vectors only to re-rank the
//! beam. That quantization layer ([OPUS-4.8] sq-nq5,
//! [`quant`](crate::quant) — [`ProductQuantizer`] + [`EncodedStore`] + [`DistanceTable`])
//! is now **wired into the search path** ([OPUS-4.8] sq-qamd): build with
//! [`DiskAnnIndex::build_with_pq`] and the greedy search ranks each visited node's neighbours by an
//! ADC [`DistanceTable`] lookup against the in-RAM codes (no disk), reading the full-precision
//! vector from the mmap only for the final beam it re-ranks — DiskANN's "search on PQ, re-rank on
//! disk" loop. Without the PQ section (the plain [`build`](DiskAnnIndex::build) /
//! [`build_with`](DiskAnnIndex::build_with) path) `search_slots` is unchanged: it computes every
//! candidate distance from the full-precision mmap, exactly as before. At the scales where the graph
//! fits in page cache (the regime the plain index unblocks: skip the per-process rebuild) the two
//! are recall-equivalent up to the PQ approximation; PQ matters most when the vectors themselves
//! exceed RAM. The `.spqg` header's 4 reserved bytes carry an **encoding tag** (`0` = no cache,
//! `1` = a trailing PQ section), so the PQ variant is a backwards-compatible addition: a plain
//! reader sees the tag and a longer file but the node-record layout is byte-identical.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-32i5) The header also carries a **graph fingerprint** (offset 32..56) binding
//! the index to the graph it was built against — see [`crate::fingerprint`] and
//! [`DiskAnnIndex::check_graph`]. A query by term resolves through the caller's graph dictionary,
//! so an index built against a different graph generation would silently mis-resolve; the checked
//! query entry points reject that. Version-1 files (no fingerprint, 32-byte header) still open but
//! are reported as unverifiable.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-wlzi) **ID-KEYED STALENESS CONTRACT.** Each node record stores its term's
//! build-time dictionary id, and neighbour entries are stored slots — so this index, like the
//! [`VectorStore`] under it, is valid ONLY against the **exact graph generation it was built
//! against**. To serve it, persist that graph (`Graph::save`) and reopen THAT graph (`Graph::open`,
//! which mmaps the **frozen** dict id order — both gated by `sparq-core`'s `mmap` feature) to resolve
//! query terms — **never re-parse the source RDF** (`Graph::load_str` et al.): sparq-core's parallel
//! sharded dict merge assigns thread-count-dependent ids, so a re-parse gives a *different*
//! `id → term` binding and `nearest_term` mis-resolves. `check_graph` is a
//! backstop, **not** a sufficient guard — the sq-xhiv fingerprint is thread-count-stable, so it PASSES
//! a re-parse of the same RDF whose ids permuted. See [`crate::fingerprint`] for the full rationale.
