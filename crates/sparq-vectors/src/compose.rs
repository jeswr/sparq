//! Read-path **URI-hiding compose** step + a closed **NL→NL A/B** harness
//! (FO-LLM-bridge **Phase 3**).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-mztg8.1 (epic sq-mztg8; design `research/fo-llm-bridge.md` §2.3 / §3.3
//! "Hide the ontology + URIs" + §6 Phase 3). This module is the **compose** half of the
//! read-path facade: it takes the answer-row bindings of a query over the PKG and presents
//! them to the agent as a **label/grounded view instead of raw IRIs**, behind the
//! `sparq-terse`/#1074 **echo/confidence envelope** ("a convenience that shows its work,
//! never an oracle that hides it"). It is **opt-in** (the new `compose` cargo feature, which
//! implies `structure` for the [`crate::grounding`] / [`verbalize`](mod@crate::verbalize)
//! machinery, off by
//! default) and changes **nothing** in the default `sparq-vectors` build or the core engine.
//!
//! # The two views being A/B'd (the closed NL→NL loop)
//!
//! A read-path serves an answer-row binding (a backbone IRI the exact engine produced) to
//! the agent in one of two presentations — this is the K4 question (design §7) the closed
//! loop measures:
//!
//! 1. [`View::UriVisible`] — the raw IRI string, exactly as the NL→SPARQL incumbent path
//!    emits it. The agent sees `<https://sparq.dev/ns/pkg/kb#topic-merge-discipline>`.
//! 2. [`View::UriHidden`] — the IRI is **stripped to a human label** ([`crate::grounding`]
//!    `OutputType::Text → Modality::NlString`, the token-budgeted
//!    [`verbalize`](mod@crate::verbalize) rendering) plus an **echo** of how it resolved
//!    (label + confidence + method). The
//!    agent sees `Merge discipline` and never the IRI; the dict-id stays opaque.
//!
//! # The governing soundness envelope (design §3.3, from sparq-terse §6 / #1074)
//!
//! Every hidden binding carries a [`ResolutionEcho`] so a silent mis-resolution is
//! **visible**, never an oracle:
//!
//! - **Always echo the resolution** — resolved label + method + confidence, even though the
//!   IRI stays hidden ([`ResolutionEcho`]).
//! - **Lexical-first** — a real `rdfs:label`/`skos:prefLabel` is an exact, full-confidence
//!   resolution ([`ResolutionMethod::Lexical`]); a fall-back to the IRI local name is a
//!   **low-confidence** resolution ([`ResolutionMethod::LocalName`]) that says so.
//! - **Confidence-gate / fall-open to the IRI** — when a binding has **no usable label at
//!   all** (confidence below [`ComposeConfig::min_confidence`]), the hidden view *keeps the
//!   raw IRI* rather than inventing a label. Hiding never costs the agent the ability to
//!   identify the node; an un-labelled node is shown as-is, loudly.
//!
//! # What this is NOT (honest scope — the non-sycophantic stance)
//!
//! - **This module does not call a model and makes no accuracy claim.** It is the
//!   *deterministic mechanism* + a *fidelity* harness. The headline K4 question — *does
//!   hiding URIs help or hurt a real small model's answer accuracy?* — needs a real-model
//!   NL→NL fan-out, which is **unmeasured** in-tree (only the `sparq-nlq` record/replay
//!   fixtures exist; there is no API key on the work box). The [`AbReport`] this module
//!   produces measures **round-trip fidelity** (does the hidden view *preserve the answer's
//!   identity* — can every shown label be mapped back to exactly the IRI it hid?) and
//!   **presentation cost** (chars the agent reads), the two things measurable without a
//!   model. The accuracy verdict is registered as **UNMEASURED** in `bench/EXPERIMENTS.md`
//!   with the pre-registered null, per the design's falsifiable-not-assumed-better stance.
//! - **No ANN re-ranking / no approximate final answer.** The bindings come from the exact
//!   engine; this module only *projects* each one to a label. The lexical resolution is
//!   exact (a real label triple) or it abstains to the IRI — it never serves a cosine guess
//!   as the shown identity.
