//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-wlzi) The **id-keyed staleness contract** for `.spqv` / `.spqg`, demonstrated
//! end-to-end. A [`VectorStore`] (and the `DiskAnnIndex` over it) is keyed by **raw dictionary term
//! id**: a query resolves `graph.id_of(term) -> id` and looks `id` up in the store. The store is
//! therefore valid ONLY against a graph whose `id -> term` binding equals the build-time binding.
//!
//! sparq-core assigns dictionary ids in a **thread-count-dependent** order (the parallel sharded
//! dict merge sizes its shard count from `rayon::current_num_threads()`), so the *same source RDF*
//! re-parsed at a different `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` gets a DIFFERENT id binding. Since sq-xhiv the graph
//! fingerprint is dict-id-order-INDEPENDENT (it folds the term SET), so that re-parsed graph
//! fingerprints IDENTICALLY and `check_graph` PASSES it — yet the raw id of a given term may now
//! denote a different term, so the store serves the WRONG vector. The fingerprint cannot catch this
//! case; the **usage discipline is the safety net**: to serve a persisted store, REOPEN the
//! persisted graph with `Graph::open` (which mmaps the FROZEN id order), NEVER re-parse the
//! source RDF.
//!
//! These two tests pin both halves of that contract:
//!   * [`sound_path_save_then_graph_open_serves_correct_vectors`] — the SOUND round-trip.
//!   * [`reparse_trap_passes_the_check_but_serves_the_wrong_vector`] — why the discipline is
//!     load-bearing: a re-parse at a different thread count passes `check_graph` yet mis-resolves.
