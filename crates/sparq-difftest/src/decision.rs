//! Admission-decision equivalence comparator with a **fail-closed asymmetry** check. [FABLE-5]
//!
//! Every trust-graph / WAC / ODRL differential test so far has hand-rolled its own allow/deny
//! set comparison in-crate. This module is the shared, engine-independent comparator: a
//! decision outcome is expressed as two plain sets — an *allow* set and a *deny* set of
//! decision tuples (canonically `(principal, mode, target)`, but the comparator is generic
//! over any `Ord` tuple type, so callers keep their own identifier types and this crate
//! stays free of any dependency on `sparq-trust` / `sparq-solid`).
//!
//! Two things are computed:
//!
//! * [`decision_diff`] — the full structural diff: allows/denies added or dropped by the
//!   [`Candidate`] relative to the [`Baseline`], and whether the two outcomes are the *same*
//!   decision.
//! * [`fail_closed_asymmetry`] — the **privilege-escalation direction** only: every tuple side
//!   the candidate **allows** that the baseline did **not** allow (the baseline either denied
//!   it or omitted it entirely — under a fail-closed policy, absence is a deny, so both are
//!   escalations). By construction this is exactly `candidate.allow \ baseline.allow`, so it
//!   has zero false negatives on that direction: a tuple escapes the report iff the baseline
//!   already allowed it. Distinct [`Baseline`] / [`Candidate`] argument types make an
//!   accidental positional swap a compile-time error.
//!
//! # Honesty
//!
//! This is a **structural set-equivalence + fail-closed-asymmetry check**, NOT a cryptographic
//! soundness proof and not a semantic model of any policy language. It compares two already
//! *evaluated* outcomes; it cannot tell which side is *correct*, and it proves nothing about
//! the policy engines that produced them (production ZK/security soundness claims remain
//! gated on the external audit, `sq-qhy4`).
