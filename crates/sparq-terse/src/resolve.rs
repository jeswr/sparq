//! `V("phrase")` lexical-first concept resolution behind the soundness envelope
//! (design §3.3 / §6, Phase 2 — the top recommendation of research #1074).
//!
//! `V("phrase")` lets an agent write the *concept it means* instead of guessing an opaque
//! content-addressed PKG IRI it cannot know a priori — attacking **grounding**, the
//! measured first-shot bottleneck in the text-to-SPARQL literature (design §1.1), rather
//! than syntax. It is parse-time sugar: the transpiler resolves `phrase` to a concept IRI
//! and splices a canonical `<iri>` into the emitted SPARQL, so the engine only ever sees
//! standard SPARQL (design §3.3).
//!
//! The resolution is **sound only behind the §6 envelope**, all of which is enforced here:
//!
//! 1. **Lexical-first, vector-fallback** (§6.4). The deterministic, no-model, no-network
//!    `sparq-nlq` lexical linker is the PRIMARY path; the vector fallback fires only when
//!    lexical returns nothing. Each [`Resolution`] records which [`Method`] fired.
//! 2. **Echo IRI + score + runner-up + confidence** (§6.2). Every binding returns a
//!    [`Resolution`] the agent can verify; a close runner-up is a visible ambiguity flag.
//! 3. **Confidence-gated, never auto-accept the uncertain** (§6.3). Below the confidence
//!    floor, or when the top score and runner-up are within the ambiguity margin, `V()`
//!    does **not** bind — it returns [`crate::TerseError::Unresolved`] with the candidate
//!    list. Loud-fail beats silent-wrong.
//! 4. **Mandatory staleness guard** (§6.5). The vector fallback verifies the store's
//!    fingerprint against the graph generation (`VectorStore::check_graph`); a store built
//!    against a different graph generation is a hard [`crate::TerseError::StaleStore`],
//!    never stale neighbours.
//!
//! The vector fallback needs the query *phrase* embedded into a vector. Embedding free text
//! requires a model — an explicit opt-in network/dependency cost the design (§3.3, §9 Q5)
//! flags. This crate does **not** force an embedder into the build: the caller supplies the
//! pre-embedded query vector (e.g. via `sparq-nlq`'s `live` path or a local model), keeping
//! this crate lean and the model dependency the caller's explicit choice. With no embedded
//! vector supplied, resolution is **lexical-only** — the no-model, deterministic default.
