//! [SONNET-4.6] sq-q0o82 (E4 follow-up) — PARALLEL-SATURATION PHASE ATTRIBUTION bench.
//!
//! The E4 increment (sq-wy3i6) parallelises only the COMPUTE phase of the bulk-synchronous
//! saturation round — the membership-triggered rule derivation against the round-start
//! snapshot. The APPLY phase (`add` / `add_link`, and under `rbox` the CR10/CR11 closure
//! inside `add_link_rbox`) is still SEQUENTIAL. Whether that matters is an empirical
//! question, and parallelising apply would put the identical-closure invariant at risk, so
//! the refinement is gated on a measurement rather than a guess. This example is that
//! measurement: it is also the first in-repo CONSUMER of `classify_graph_par`, exercising
//! the thread-count knob end to end.
//!
//! Run:
//!
//!     cargo run -p sparq-reason-el --features par --release --example par_phase_bench [SCALE]
//!     cargo run -p sparq-reason-el --features par,rbox --release --example par_phase_bench -- <ontology.nt> ntriples
//!
//! TWO MODES
//! ---------
//!   * SYNTHETIC (no args, or a numeric SCALE): classify a generated wide-taxonomy +
//!     existential-traversal TBox — a shape whose saturation rounds carry a WIDE frontier, so
//!     the worker pool actually engages — at several thread counts, and ASSERT the two
//!     invariants that make the measurement trustworthy:
//!
//!       1. CLOSURE UNCHANGED — the emitted triples and `Report` at every thread count are
//!          bit-identical to the sequential `classify_graph`. (`tests/par_differential.rs`
//!          pins this over the fixture corpus; re-asserting it here means a phase number is
//!          never reported for a run that silently derived something else.)
//!       2. WORK COUNTS THREAD-INVARIANT — `rounds`, `frontier_items`, `derived_members` and
//!          `derived_links` are identical at every thread count. Chunking decides WHICH
//!          worker derives a conclusion, never WHICH conclusions are derived, so a drift here
//!          means a partitioning bug, not a scheduling artefact.
//!
//!     Exits 0 iff both hold, so it is a non-vacuous acceptance run, not just a printout.
//!
//!   * GATHER (`<path> [format]`, `format` defaults to `turtle`): classify an arbitrary
//!     ontology converted to RDF — a riot-converted GO / OpenGALEN / SNOMED-scale dump, as
//!     gathered by `scripts/bench/reason-el-same-box.sh` — and print the same phase row with
//!     NO assertion. This is the row the "does the apply phase dominate on a REAL ontology?"
//!     decision is made on; it needs an ontology this repo does not vendor.
//!
//! READING THE OUTPUT: `apply_frac` is the decision metric — the share of measured saturation
//! time spent in the sequential apply phase. Near 1 means compute-only parallelism is
//! Amdahl-bound and a sharded/work-stealing apply is worth its determinism cost; small means
//! it is not. Absolute seconds are TREND-ONLY: work-box wall-clock is non-canonical (a
//! contended runner inflates both phases), which is exactly why the ratio is reported and no
//! timing figure from this bench belongs in documentation.
