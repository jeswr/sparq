// [OPUS-4.8] sq-s2nob: Phase E3 — transitive reduction to the DIRECT-subsumer Hasse diagram,
// with equivalence-class collapse and a membership-indexed reduction step.
//
// The E1/E2 saturator ([`crate::classify`]) produces, for every named class C, the COMPLETE set
// of named subsumers S(C) = { D : C ⊑ D }. That is the full transitive closure — exactly what a
// `is_subclass_of` query needs, but O(N²) edges to MATERIALIZE on a deep taxonomy (a chain of
// depth N has N·(N+1)/2 closure edges). A class HIERARCHY (the thing a user browses, and the
// `rdfs:subClassOf` taxonomy most ontology tools want) is the *transitive reduction*: the
// minimal edge set whose transitive closure is S — i.e. only the DIRECT (immediate) subsumers.
//
// ELK ("The Incredible ELK", Kazakov–Krötzsch–Simančík, JAR 2014, §"taxonomy construction")
// emits exactly this Hasse diagram, plus equivalence classes (mutually-subsuming cliques). This
// module reproduces that step over sparq's `(Dict, Id)` lattice:
//
//   1. EQUIVALENCE collapse — C ≡ D iff C ⊑ D and D ⊑ C. Group named classes into equivalence
//      cliques; pick the smallest dict id as each clique's representative. The subsumption DAG
//      over representatives is acyclic (a partial order), the precondition for a well-defined
//      transitive reduction.
//   2. TRANSITIVE REDUCTION over the representative DAG — a (strict) super-rep D of rep C is
//      DIRECT iff no OTHER strict super-rep E of C also has E ⊑ D. Equivalently: D is direct iff
//      it is not implied by any other super-rep of C. We test this with an O(1) membership query
//      against the precomputed subsumer HASHSET of C (the "join cache" / indexing this phase adds
//      — without it the inner check would re-scan S(E) for every pair, O(N³)).
//
// The result is DETERMINISTIC (representative = min dict id; outputs sorted by dict id), so the
// emitted-edge COUNT is a hard, load-robust assertion target — the E3 acceptance gate — while
// wall-clock stays advisory (spike §5 E3). This whole module is behind the default-OFF `hasse`
// feature: the E1/E2 build carries zero reduction code and is byte-identical without it.
