// [OPUS-4.8] sq-pbz04.2.6 — the two EL++ self-restriction (`owl:hasSelf` / `ObjectHasSelf`)
// completion rules. `∃r.Self` (the LOCAL reflexivity concept `{x | (x,x) ∈ r}`) is extracted as
// a distinguished basic concept atom (`Names::self_concept`), so `X ⊑ ∃r.Self` and `∃r.Self ⊑ D`
// reduce to ordinary `Normal::Sub` axioms and CR1/CR2/CR4 propagate `∃r.Self` memberships for
// free. CRs1 is the ONE genuinely new rule (implemented in the worklist below): when the atom
// `∃r.Self` lands in S(X) — i.e. `X ⊑ ∃r.Self` — it adds the reflexive link `(X,X) ∈ R(r)` (which
// then feeds CR4/CR5). CRs2 is realised BY CR1: `∃r.Self ⊑ D` is the axiom `Sub(self_r, D)`, so
// `∃r.Self ∈ S(X)` fires `D ∈ S(X)` directly. SOUNDNESS side-condition (load-bearing): CRs2's
// premise `(X,X) ∈ R(r)` is tracked as the self-concept membership `∃r.Self ∈ S(X)`, NOT the raw
// R-link — a general self-link from CR3 (`X ⊑ ∃r.X`, whose invariant is only `X ⊑ ∃r.X`, NOT
// `X ⊑ ∃r.Self`) must NEVER trigger CRs2. CRs1 IS sound to add to the ordinary link set because
// `X ⊑ ∃r.Self ⟹ X ⊑ ∃r.X` (the self-successor is X itself), so the R-invariant holds.
//
// [FABLE-5] sq-8zqwb (EL wave-2) — CRs3, the NOMINAL-REFLEXIVITY converse of CRs1: a SAME-NOMINAL
// self-link `({a},{a}) ∈ R(r)` (e.g. the internalized assertion `a r a`, asserted OR derived)
// reads off as `∃r.Self ∈ S({a})`. SOUND because a nominal denotes a singleton: the R-invariant
// gives `T ⊨ {a} ⊑ ∃r.{a}`, so a^I's r-successor inside `{a^I}` IS a^I itself — `(a^I,a^I) ∈ r^I`,
// which is exactly `a^I ∈ (∃r.Self)^I`, i.e. `T ⊨ {a} ⊑ ∃r.Self`. The nominal guard is
// load-bearing: for a GENERAL X the CRs2 side-condition above stands unchanged (each member of X
// has SOME r-successor in X, not necessarily itself). Implemented at the single link chokepoint
// (`add_link`), so asserted, derived, and (under `rbox`) role-closed self-links all fire it in
// BOTH engines; on a hasSelf-free ontology the `∃r.Self` lookup is `None` and nothing changes.
// Graduates the WG `New-Feature-SelfRestriction-002` converse shape ("Peter likes Peter ⊨ Peter
// ∈ ∃likes.Self") that sq-pbz04.2.6 pinned as an honest boundary (deferred from #1681).
//
// CR4 is the load-bearing existential-traversal rule that OWL 2 RL lacks (spike §1.2): it is
// the only rule that reasons THROUGH an r-successor, and it is why running `--reason owl` over
// an EL ontology returns a silently-incomplete hierarchy. The implementation is a worklist
// saturation: a per-concept queue of newly-derived subsumers drives rule application, so each
// derived membership is processed once. CR6 (the nominal rule, "Pushing the EL Envelope"
// IJCAI-05) runs as a between-fixpoint pass — see `cr6_pass` for the rule, the ⇝_R
// side-condition, and the soundness argument. Single-threaded by default (Phase E1); the opt-in
// `par` feature (Phase E4, sq-wy3i6) adds the deterministic bulk-synchronous parallel engine at
// the tail of this file — same rules, same least fixpoint, identical closure at every thread count.
//
// ## Substrate adoption evaluation -- REASONED NON-ADOPTION [SONNET-4.6] sq-pbz04.2.3
//
// Bead sq-pbz04.2.3 evaluated whether the CR1-CR5 saturation joins can adopt the shared
// `sparq_substrate::join` kernels (the `build_table`/`probe_emit`/`hash_probe_serial` and
// `join::delta::DeltaTable` path, analogously to `sparq-reason/src/substrate_join.rs`
// which drives rdfs2/3/7 on the substrate). Disposition: DOCUMENTED NON-ADOPTION.
// Referenced from `research/reasoner-federation-program.md` sections 3 and 6.
//
// Five structural reasons this module's join shapes are not profitable substrate consumers:
//
// 1. PER-EVENT WORKLIST, NOT BATCH BUILD/PROBE. The substrate `build_table`+`probe_emit`
//    requires two static `&[Row]` slices: a build side and a batch of probe rows. The EL
//    fixpoint processes memberships one at a time from a `Vec<(Concept, Concept)>` worklist;
//    each dequeued `(X, D)` immediately fires rules whose outputs re-enter the queue before
//    the outer loop resumes. Batching would require collecting an entire delta round first,
//    but the five rules have heterogeneous triggers and no meaningful "round" boundary --
//    unlike the OWL-RL semi-naive `delta join full` pattern `DeltaTable` was designed for.
//
// 2. SIMULTANEOUS READ AND WRITE ON THE SAME RELATIONS. CR2 reads `S(X)` (checks whether
//    a partner conjunct is already present) while CR1/CR3/CR4/CR5 write new members into
//    `S(X)` within the same worklist pass. The substrate kernels assume `&[Row]` immutability
//    at probe time; there is no safe seam to hand `S(X)` to a kernel as a probe slice while
//    also holding it mutably for insertion. The `add()` helper at the bottom of this file is
//    called inside rule-specific borrows that cannot be widened to a whole-relation borrow.
//
// 3. AXIOMINDEX IS ALREADY AN OPTIMAL SINGLE-KEY HASH TABLE. The `AxiomIndex` fields are
//    `FxHashMap<Concept, Vec<...>>` keyed by `Concept = u32` -- a direct O(1) lookup using
//    the native integer hash. Reshaping to substrate `Row` (`SmallVec<[u32; 4]>`) build
//    tables would add per-axiom `Row::from_slice` allocation and per-lookup key projection
//    through `JoinKeys`, replacing a 4-byte integer hash with a `SmallVec` hash over the
//    same data. Asymptotic complexity is identical; the per-lookup constant is strictly
//    higher with no algorithmic benefit.
//
// 4. CR4 IS A 3-WAY TRIANGLE JOIN WITH THREE GROWING SIDES. CR4 combines S(Y) memberships,
//    R(r) predecessor links, and axiom index lookups, where both S(Y) and R(r) grow during
//    the same pass. The substrate handles 2-way binary joins (static build probed by a
//    batch probe slice) and the 2-way semi-naive delta/full shape. The EL triangle -- where
//    S-sets, R-links, and AxiomIndex all inform the same rule firing -- has no direct
//    mapping to any of the four substrate kernels (merge-join, hash-join, bind-join,
//    trie-join) or to the `DeltaTable` seam. Forcing it would require rebuilding all three
//    sides at each queue step, which is strictly worse than the current per-event probe.
//
// 5. THE QL PRECEDENT APPLIES IN FULL. The OWL 2 QL certain-answer oracle (sq-qo1a9) is a
//    documented non-consumer of the substrate join kernels: its query-rewriting shape
//    (PerfectRef + tree-witness + UCQ minimisation) is not a build/probe or semi-naive
//    fixpoint. The EL worklist fixpoint is a cleaner non-consumer still: QL at least
//    evaluates CQ answers over a static dataset, which could use the engine join path;
//    EL saturation joins never produce a relational tuple output -- they grow set-based
//    state incrementally, and every "join" is a membership test, not a tuple production.
//
// Comparison with the RDFS precedent (`sparq-reason/src/substrate_join.rs`, sq-yk6or):
// rdfs2/3/7 are profitable substrate consumers because (a) the schema closure maps are
// built ONCE and probed many times without mutation, and (b) the output is a multiset
// of triples, exactly what `probe_emit`'s combined-row output models. Neither condition
// holds here: S(X) and R(r) grow during every worklist step, and the output is
// side-effectful set membership, not a combinatorial tuple join.
//
// Also mirroring the note in `substrate_join.rs` module doc: "The OWL-RL semi-naive
// fixpoint (owl.rs): a delta-driven delta/full join with union-find sameAs
// canonicalisation. Genuinely a different (incremental, mutating) join shape than the
// substrate's static &[Row] build/probe kernel." The EL worklist is even more tightly
// coupled, with no round boundary to hang a delta on.
//
// Conclusion: this module stays on its hand-rolled FxHashMap worklist. There is no
// profitable behaviour-neutral seam to the substrate kernels for CR1-CR5. [FABLE-5]
// sq-wy3i6 (the E4 concurrency this note anticipated): the `par` engine batches the
// frontier into bulk-synchronous ROUNDS, but each rule firing is still a per-membership
// hash-set probe against mutating S/R state (the apply phase mutates between rounds), so
// reasons 2-4 hold unchanged and the non-adoption verdict stands for the parallel path too.

///
/// Write `L` for the least fixpoint of the completion rules over `axioms` (what [`saturate`]
/// would compute) and `S0` for the retained pre-edit state.
///
/// * **`S0` is contained in `L` (nothing retained is wrong).** Every retained membership/link was
///   derived by these same monotone rules from a SUBSET of `axioms` — monotonicity of the edit is
///   exactly this premise — so it is derivable from `axioms` too, hence in `L`.
/// * **The resumed run ends closed under every rule.** The drain's invariant is "every membership
///   whose rules have not yet fired against the CURRENT axiom index is queued". The seeding below
///   re-establishes it: (a) rows minted by the edit get the full `init` seed; (b) for every axiom
///   in `added`, every retained membership matching one of its TRIGGER keys is re-queued, so each
///   new axiom is re-tried against the whole retained state; (c) axioms that are NOT new already
///   fired against every retained membership before the edit, and fire again for anything
///   inserted after it. Link-triggered CR4/CR5 (and the `rbox` CR10/CR11 closure) run inside
///   `add_link` for every link the drain inserts, and no pre-existing link can need a new axiom
///   without being reached: `ExistsSub(r, c, e)`'s membership-triggered arm is seeded by (b) via
///   the key `c`, which visits every successor `Y` with `c` in `S(Y)` and from there every
///   predecessor link already in `r_pred`.
/// * **Therefore the result is `L`.** It is a fixpoint containing the `init` seeds, so it contains
///   `L`; and it is built from `S0` (contained in `L`) by sound rule applications over `axioms`,
///   so it is contained in `L`.
///
/// Cost: one scan of the retained closure to locate the trigger contexts, then rule work only for
/// the seeded frontier and its cascade — instead of re-firing every rule for every membership as
/// a full re-saturation does. Internal FRESH normalization names are NOT reused across edits (the
/// delta mints its own), so the concept index grows with edit history; the NAMED-class projection
/// is unaffected (a fresh name never carries a dict id), which is why `tests/incremental.rs` can

//   2. APPLY (sequential): the derived memberships/links are applied IN CHUNK ORDER through
//      the exact single-threaded `add` / `add_link` (/ `add_link_rbox`) machinery, so the
//      link-triggered half of CR4/CR5 — and the whole CR10/CR11 role closure under `rbox` —
//      runs unchanged; newly-inserted memberships form the next round's frontier.
//
// The CR6 nominal pass alternates with the drained worklist exactly as in `saturate_inner`
// (it is a between-fixpoint pass in both engines and stays sequential).
//
// ## Completeness (no rule firing is lost to an interleaving)
//
// The queue-item invariant of the sequential engine is preserved verbatim: a pair `(X, D)`
// is enqueued ONLY after `D` is inserted into `S(X)`, so every frontier membership is
// visible in the snapshot its own round computes against. For any rule instance whose
// premises all eventually hold, order the premise-insertion events; the LAST one is either
// (a) a membership event — its compute round starts after every other premise was inserted,
// so the snapshot contains them all and the instance fires there (for CR2 this is exactly
// the "partner conjunct already present" probe; for membership-triggered CR4/CR5 the link
// premise is already in `r_pred`); or (b) a link event — `add_link` runs in the SEQUENTIAL
// apply phase and scans the LIVE `S(f)` at insertion time, which contains every earlier
// membership (and under `rbox`, `add_link_rbox` closes CR10/CR11 against the live link
// relation exactly as in the sequential engine). Either way the instance fires; no firing
// depends on two premises that each miss the other.
//
// ## Soundness + determinism of the RESULT
//
// Workers only READ the snapshot; since the state grows monotonically, every premise a
// worker observes still holds at apply time, so each applied conclusion is a genuine rule
// firing (duplicates are absorbed by the same set-insert dedup as the sequential engine).
// All rules are monotone and bounded, so the closure is the unique LEAST FIXPOINT — the
// same one `saturate_inner` computes — independent of thread count, chunk boundaries, or
// interleaving. On top of that set-level guarantee, chunk results are applied in
// deterministic (frontier) order, so a given input + thread count replays bit-identically.
//
// `Saturation`, `AxiomIndex` and `Names` are plain owned maps/vecs (no interior
// mutability), hence `Sync`; the scoped borrows need no `unsafe` (the crate forbids it).

/// [SONNET-4.6] sq-q0o82 (E4 follow-up): per-phase attribution for one parallel-saturation

/// crate-root re-export, so its docs must stay resolvable under the all-features rustdoc gate.)

/// the CR10/CR11 closure inside `add_link_rbox`) stays sequential. Refining apply is only
