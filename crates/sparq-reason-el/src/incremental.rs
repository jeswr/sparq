// [SONNET-4.6] sq-clsv6 (Phase E5, `incremental`): incremental classification under TBox edits.
//
// Spike: research/owl2-el-ql-reasoning-spike.md §5 (EL-track E5). The E1–E4 entries
// (`Classifier::classify` / `classify_graph` / their `par` twins) are STATELESS: every call
// re-extracts the TBox and re-runs the CR1–CR6 fixpoint from scratch. An ontology-authoring or
// stream-ingest loop that edits a TBox and re-classifies pays that from-scratch cost per edit even
// when the edit added three triples to a 300k-axiom ontology. This module keeps the saturation
// ALIVE across edits and, for the edit shape that is provably monotone, folds the delta into it.
//
// ## What is actually incremental, and what is not (read this before believing the name)
//
// EL saturation is a MONOTONE least fixpoint, which cuts exactly one way:
//
// * **Addition is incremental.** Adding axioms can only ADD subsumptions, so the retained closure
//   stays valid and only the contexts a new axiom can trigger need re-processing. That is
//   `classify::resaturate`, whose doc comment carries the least-fixpoint argument for why the
//   result is bit-for-bit the closure a from-scratch run computes.
// * **Retraction is NOT.** Removing an axiom can invalidate a derived subsumption, and the
//   saturation keeps no provenance to find which — repairing it needs either derivation
//   bookkeeping (DRed) or ELK's affected-context tracking (Kazakov & Klinov, "Incremental
//   Reasoning in OWL EL without Bookkeeping", ISWC 2013). NEITHER IS IMPLEMENTED HERE. A retraction
//   falls back to a full re-classification, reported as [`FullReason::Retraction`].
//
// So this is an incremental-ADDITION classifier with an honest full-rebuild fallback, not a
// general incremental reasoner. Every edit returns the [`EditDisposition`] it took, so a caller can
// SEE which path ran instead of assuming the fast one; the deletion half is deferred, never faked.
// The one guarantee that holds unconditionally, on BOTH paths, is the one the E5 acceptance
// criterion asks for: the hierarchy after an edit equals a full re-classification of the edited
// graph (`tests/incremental.rs` pins it edit-by-edit against the ELK-derived closure oracle and
// against `Classifier::classify`).
//
// ## Honest cost notes
//
// Every edit rebuilds the structural index over the FULL post-edit graph (one linear pass, no
// fixpoint) so a new axiom's class nodes decode against the same neighbourhood a from-scratch run
// would see, and the incremental path additionally scans the retained closure once to locate the
// contexts a new axiom can trigger. The win is skipping the SATURATION, not the extraction scan;
// on a small graph the fixed costs can dominate and the incremental path is not automatically
// faster. No timing figure is asserted here — this box is not canonical.
