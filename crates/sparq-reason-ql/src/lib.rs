#![forbid(unsafe_code)] // [OPUS-4.8] sq-t5bne: crate has zero `unsafe`.

//! See the crate README (rendered above) for the capability overview and the honest scope.
//!
//! The load-bearing entry points are [`as_conjunctive_query`] and [`as_ucq`] (the always-present,
//! fail-closed **CQ/UCQ-shape gates**) and, behind the off-by-default `experimental` feature,
//! `rewrite` (the baseline PerfectRef DL-Lite_R query rewriter) and `rewrite_production` (the
//! production path: PerfectRef + tree-witness folding + UCQ-containment minimisation). Behind the
//! off-by-default `ql-consistency` feature (which pulls `experimental`), `check_consistency` /
//! `check_consistency_with` decide DL-Lite_R KB consistency by violation-query composition
//! (sq-p6yb7). All are plain code spans here, not intra-doc links, since those items are absent
//! from the default-feature doc surface. The algorithm lives in six modules: `cq` (the gate),
//! `dllite` (TBox extraction), `perfectref` (the rewrite/reduce saturation), `treewitness`
//! (bounded existential-witness folding), `minimise` (UCQ-containment minimisation by
//! homomorphism), and `consistency` (the violation-query satisfiability check).
//!
//! The rewriter is validated two independent ways: syntactically against a hand-checked DL-Lite_R
//! oracle, and executably against an OWL 2 RL materialise-then-query baseline
//! (`tests/rl_baseline_differential.rs`, sq-wxaas) — on fixtures inside the RL ∩ QL overlap the
//! rewrite-the-query and close-the-data strategies must return identical answers, while an
//! existential-generating axiom (which has no OWL 2 RL superclass form) pins the direction of the
//! profiles' legitimate divergence: QL strictly richer, never poorer. On the FORMAL DL-Lite_R
//! suite (the hand-derived certain-answer oracle from sq-g19x0) the rewrite is sound AND complete
//! case by case — that has GRADUATED to a pinned floor (sq-qo1a9): `sparq-conformance`'s
//! `ql_dllite_suite` runner rewrites each case and asserts its UCQ, evaluated over the unmodified
//! ABox, returns exactly the hand-derived certain answers; it is a `sparq extension` row in the
//! central scoreboard (tallied separately, NOT a full-OWL-2-QL-conformance claim, since no runnable
//! normative W3C QL certain-answer suite exists). The BROADER `pr:QL` `sparql11/entailment` arm
//! (sq-kuvu3, opt-in `sparq-conformance/ql-experimental`) stays experimental / OutOfScope — it
//! mixes intensional cases outside sound rewriting, so the harness reports honestly what it
//! computes (fail-closed abstain / computed-equivalent evidence / computed-divergent gap), never a
//! graduated conformance pass — see the README.
