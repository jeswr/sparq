// [OPUS-4.8] sq-t5bne (epic sq-pbz04): the STRICT, FAIL-CLOSED CQ-shape gate.
// [SONNET-4.6] sq-pbz04.3.1: broaden the sound input fragment — UCQ (B1), literal-object atoms
// (B2 is in emit.rs), FILTER on distinguished-only vars (B3), constant-only VALUES over
// distinguished vars (B4), intensional-atom guard (B6).
//
// PerfectRef (and every OWL 2 QL query-rewriting algorithm) is sound + complete only for
// (unions of) CONJUNCTIVE QUERIES — the Pérez–Arenas–Gutiérrez "AND-only" fragment with an
// outer projection/distinct. Firing the rewrite on anything else SILENTLY LOSES OR INVENTS
// answers (the research records call this the #1 unsoundness trap: applicability is the
// load-bearing condition). So this gate is the soundness keystone of the whole crate: it is
// the FIRST thing every public rewriting entry point runs, and it REJECTS — never silently
// degrades — any query outside the CQ fragment as [`CqError::OutOfScope`].
//
// Crucially this module carries NO `cfg(feature = "experimental")`: the gate is always
// compiled and always cheap (a structural walk of the parsed algebra, no TBox, no rewriting),
// so the fail-closed classification is available even to a caller that has NOT enabled the
// rewriter. The rewriter (behind `experimental`) calls into the gate; it can never bypass it.
//
// ## Broadened shapes (sq-pbz04.3.1) and their soundness arguments
//
// B1. UCQ (top-level UNION of CQ branches): PerfectRef is defined over UCQs in the source
//     paper (Calvanese et al., JAR 2007). Each branch is rewired independently and the results
//     unioned. Certain answers distribute over union in DL-Lite_R. FAIL-CLOSED: each branch
//     must independently pass the CQ gate; a branch leaving a projected variable unbound is
//     rejected because UCQ answer-arity is uniform.
//
// B3. FILTER on distinguished-only variables: For q'(x) = q(x) ∧ F(x) with vars(F) ⊆
//     distinguished, certain answers are ground bindings of the answer vars, and F reads only
//     those. The rewriter passes F through unmodified — SPARQL evaluation semantics apply on
//     both sides of the rewrite. FAIL-CLOSED: a FILTER mentioning any non-distinguished
//     variable is rejected (its value on an anonymous witness is undefined).
//
// B4. Constant-only VALUES over distinguished vars: A VALUES block whose vars are all
//     distinguished and whose rows are fully bound constants is equivalent to a disjunction
//     of equality filters over answer variables. B3's argument applies verbatim. FAIL-CLOSED:
//     UNDEF cells or non-distinguished variables → rejected.
//
// B6. Intensional-atom guard (a deliberate NARROWING): the gate currently admits role atoms
//     whose predicate is semantics-bearing schema vocabulary (rdfs:subClassOf,
//     rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:domain, rdfs:range, and the owl: axiom vocabulary). The
//     rewriter evaluates those over ABox triples only — silently MISSING TBox-entailed schema
//     facts (reflexivity, transitive closure, entailed subsumptions). That violates the
//     completeness half of the certain-answer contract. Fix: such atoms are now REJECTED as
//     `OutOfScope("intensional/schema-vocabulary atom")`. Annotation predicates
//     (rdfs:label/comment/seeAlso/isDefinedBy) remain admitted as plain role atoms.
//
// B5. Non-recursive property-path desugaring (sq-pbz04.3.2, design record §5 B5). The three
//     recursion-free path constructors are SPARQL-1.1-algebra query equivalences, applied to the
//     peeled body BEFORE the entailment rewrite (after which B1/PerfectRef soundness applies to
//     the result):
//       - sequence      `X p1/p2 Y  ≡  X p1 ?f . ?f p2 Y`   (fresh NON-distinguished `?f`);
//       - inverse       `X ^p Y     ≡  Y p X`               (subject/object swap);
//       - alternation   `X p1|p2 Y  ≡  { X p1 Y } UNION { X p2 Y }`  (branch multiplication
//                                                            into the B1 UCQ machinery).
//     STEP 0 finding (verified against the vendored spargebra parser, `add_to_triple_or_path_patterns`):
//     the PARSER already lowers a top-level SEQUENCE to a BGP joined by a fresh blank node, and a
//     top-level INVERSE of a simple predicate to a swapped BGP triple — so those never reach the
//     gate as a `Path`; the emitter already lifts the blank-node intermediate to a fresh
//     existential (sq-pbz04.3.6). The ONLY non-recursive form that survives parsing as a
//     `GraphPattern::Path` is ALTERNATION (whose arms may nest sequence/inverse/named-node), so
//     [`desugar_paths_dnf`] desugars exactly those surviving `Path` nodes — it does NOT
//     re-translate what the parser already normalised (no double-translation). The fresh
//     sequence intermediate is a SHARED variable across its two atoms, so PerfectRef's
//     applicability condition correctly treats it as bound (identical to the blank-node path).
//     `+` / `*` / `?` (zero-length-path semantics) and negated property sets stay
//     PERMANENT-REJECT (fail-closed) — they reintroduce the recursion/reflexivity QL excludes.
//
// ## Unchanged PERMANENT-REJECT shapes
//
// OPTIONAL (non-monotone), MINUS (non-monotone), recursive / zero-length / negated property
// paths (`+`/`*`/`?`/`!p` — reintroduce recursion/reflexivity), GRAPH (named-graph rewriting
// semantics unsettled), BIND/Extend (arithmetic, not CQ), aggregation, SERVICE, sub-SELECT,
// LATERAL, RDF-star quoted triples, variable predicates — all stay REJECTED with their
// original reason strings.
