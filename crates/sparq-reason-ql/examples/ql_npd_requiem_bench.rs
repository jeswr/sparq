//! [SONNET-4.6] sq-hmd7l.9 (epic sq-hmd7l): the sparq leg of the OWL 2 QL rewriting comparison
//! vs Ontop on the NPD + Requiem suites (`scripts/bench/reason-ql-same-box.sh`). Run:
//!
//!     cargo run -p sparq-reason-ql --example ql_npd_requiem_bench --release --features experimental -- --smoke
//!     cargo run -p sparq-reason-ql --example ql_npd_requiem_bench --release --features experimental -- \
//!         <suite> <tbox.nt|.ttl> <queries-dir> [--abox <data.nt|.ttl>]
//!
//! TWO metrics, both required by the bead: rewrite WALL TIME and output UCQ SIZE (disjunct
//! count). REGIME LABELS (printed in the `#`-prefixed banner, echoed into the harness
//! envelope): the `*_rewrite_ms` columns are REWRITER-PHASE ONLY (in-process `rewrite` /
//! `rewrite_production`, no execution); `exec_ms`/`e2e_ms` (only with `--abox`) are the
//! execution of the minimised UCQ over the loaded ABox and rewrite+execute respectively —
//! the column comparable to Ontop's end-to-end CLI regime.
//!
//! THE UCQ-EQUIVALENCE SANITY CHECK IS THE GATE (the sq-hmd7l.9 INVARIANT). Before ANY
//! timing row is printed for a query, the RAW PerfectRef UCQ (`rewrite`) and the MINIMISED
//! production UCQ (`rewrite_production`) are BOTH executed over the same data and their
//! result SETS must agree — containment minimisation must never change answers. In gather
//! mode without `--abox` the data is a set of deterministic PER-DISJUNCT WITNESS databases:
//! the frozen canonical instance of every CQ disjunct of the original query, the raw UCQ,
//! and the minimised UCQ (variables/blank nodes frozen to fresh per-disjunct IRIs; IRI and
//! literal constants kept as-is), each disjunct's instance held in its OWN isolated database.
//! Raw and minimised are evaluated over EACH database separately and must agree on each. Every
//! disjunct matches at least its own frozen instance via the identity homomorphism — including
//! query-only predicates absent from the TBox and multi-atom shared-variable joins — so on a
//! given disjunct D's isolated instance the retained UCQ reproduces D's frozen head ONLY via a
//! homomorphism into D's own instance, i.e. only when D was genuinely subsumed: a minimisation
//! that drops a NON-subsumed disjunct fails agreement on that disjunct's database (the classical
//! per-CQ canonical-database containment argument for UCQs). ISOLATION is load-bearing: unioning
//! the instances into one graph would SHARE the retained IRI/literal constants and let a retained
//! disjunct bridge a fact from a dropped disjunct's instance with a fact from a third instance
//! through a shared constant, reproducing the dropped head and masking the unsound drop. Witness
//! mode is FAIL-CLOSED on modifiers: a query whose original/raw/minimised tree carries a
//! re-applied FILTER or VALUES (the B3/B4 pass-through) gets NO witness — the modifier
//! could reject every frozen binding, leaving BOTH UCQs empty and the gate vacuously
//! agreed — and is reported per-row as `needs-abox` with NO timing row; such queries are
//! only timed under `--abox` real data. A disagreement aborts the run (exit 1) — it is
//! an unsoundness signal, never papered over with a plausible timing.
//!
//! `--smoke` is the hermetic acceptance path (no network, no files): NPD/Requiem-shaped
//! fixtures with HAND-VERIFIED closed-form minimised-UCQ sizes and pinned certain-answer
//! counts, each asserted before its timing row — same discipline as `ql_rewrite_bench`'s
//! closed forms (which this example does NOT touch).
//!
//! Out-of-scope queries (OPTIONAL/FILTER/aggregation/… — the fail-closed CQ gate) are
//! REPORTED per-row as `out-of-scope`, not errors: on the real NPD query mix that count is
//! itself an honest datum about rewriter coverage.
