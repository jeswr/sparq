// [SONNET-4.6] sq-wxaas (QL track, phase Q1): the RL-MATERIALISE-THEN-QUERY acceptance oracle.
//
// The crate's other oracle (`tests/oracle.rs`) checks the rewriter SYNTACTICALLY — it pins the
// exact union of conjunctive queries PerfectRef must emit against hand-derived expectations. That
// is necessary but not sufficient: a UCQ can be the textbook-correct rewriting and still be
// mis-evaluated, and a syntactic oracle can only ever be as right as the hand derivation.
//
// This file closes that gap with an INDEPENDENT, EXECUTABLE baseline: the certain answers the
// rewriter computes are compared against the answers sparq's OWL 2 RL materialiser
// (`sparq_reason::materialize(Profile::OwlRl, …)`) produces for the SAME query over the SAME
// input graph. Two entirely separate reasoning strategies — rewrite-the-query vs
// close-the-data — must agree wherever both are complete.
//
// ## Why the two strategies are comparable at all, and exactly where they are not
//
// OWL 2 RL and OWL 2 QL are INCOMPARABLE profiles; a naive "RL and QL must always agree" oracle
// would be dishonest. The overlap where BOTH are complete for ABox (instance-retrieval) answers
// is the fragment used by the `Agreement::Exact` fixtures below:
//
//   * `A rdfs:subClassOf B` between named classes  — RL `cax-sco`   / QL `A ⊑ B`
//   * `R rdfs:subPropertyOf S`                     — RL `prp-spo1`  / QL `R ⊑ S`
//   * `R owl:inverseOf S`                          — RL `prp-inv1/2`/ QL `R ⊑ S⁻`, `S⁻ ⊑ R`
//   * `R rdfs:domain A`                            — RL `prp-dom`   / QL `∃R ⊑ A`
//   * `R rdfs:range A`                             — RL `prp-rng`   / QL `∃R⁻ ⊑ A`
//   * `A owl:equivalentClass B` between named classes — RL `cax-eqc1/2` / QL `A ⊑ B` + `B ⊑ A`
//
// OUTSIDE that overlap the profiles genuinely diverge, and the divergence has a DIRECTION. The
// `Agreement::QlStrictlyRicher` fixture pins it: an EXISTENTIAL-GENERATING axiom `A ⊑ ∃R` is
// QL-legal but has no OWL 2 RL superclass form at all (`owl:someValuesFrom` is not an RL
// superclass expression), so RL materialisation invents no witness and silently returns fewer
// answers. That is the structural RL incompleteness recorded in
// `research/owl2-el-ql-reasoning-spike.md` §1 — the capability gap QL exists to fill — so the
// test asserts RL ⊊ QL there rather than pretending the two agree.
//
// Both routes are handed the IDENTICAL input graph (TBox triples and ABox triples in one Turtle
// document); the only difference is the reasoning strategy. The rewritten UCQ is evaluated over
// the UNMODIFIED data, which is the FO-rewritability property under test.
