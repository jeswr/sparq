//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-2te / sq-ashy — HDT WRITE support: serialise a sparq [`Graph`] to
//! an `.hdt` archive (the mirror of [`crate::load`]).
//!
//! ## The write path (direct in-memory encode — no N-Triples round-trip)
//!
//! [`save`] encodes the HDT sections DIRECTLY from sparq's in-memory dictionary +
//! triple ids via [`crate::encode::write_hdt`] — the inverse of [`crate::decode`].
//! It builds the FourSectionDictionary (Plain Front Coding) and the BitmapTriples
//! (SPO) from the data sparq already holds and writes them in the exact byte layout
//! [`hdt::Hdt::write`] produces.
//!
//! ### What this replaced (bead sq-ashy)
//!
//! The original path (bead sq-2te, the LOW/EASY route) round-tripped through a
//! TEMPORARY N-Triples file: it rendered the whole graph as N-Triples text on disk,
//! then re-parsed it through [`hdt::Hdt::read_nt`] (re-interning every term and
//! re-sorting the triples sparq already had) before serialising. That materialised
//! the whole graph as text and re-did sparq's ingest work; the direct encoder skips
//! both the temp file and the text parse. The upstream-backed reader
//! ([`crate::load_reader_via_upstream`]) is kept as the differential oracle the
//! write round-trip tests check the direct encoder against.
//!
//! Output containers (`.hdt.gz` / `.hdt.zst` / `.hdt.bz2`) are chosen by the OUTPUT
//! path's extension (the write side cannot sniff content that does not exist yet, so
//! it honours the file name the caller chose); the encoder streams its bytes through
//! the matching compressing writer — the bare `.hdt` is never fully materialised.
