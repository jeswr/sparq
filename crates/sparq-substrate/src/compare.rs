//! The shared SPARQL **term total order** — the `ORDER BY` / `MIN`/`MAX`-fallback
//! lenient comparison and the recursive RDF-1.2 triple-term ordering.
//!
//! This is the SPARQL engine's `compare_values` total order, **moved here** from
//! `sparq-engine::exec`, generalised over a tiny [`CompareTerm`] trait rather than
//! the engine's private `Value` enum + `Term` / `Num` / `Timeline` subsystem. The
//! engine implements [`CompareTerm`] for its `Value` (the impl is a set of zero-cost
//! wrappers over its existing `value_str` / numeric / strict-typed-compare helpers)
//! and calls [`compare_terms`]; a reasoner that materialises ordered solutions (RIF
//! `order`, an EL/QL `ORDER BY` over an entailed answer set) can implement the SAME
//! trait for its own term representation and reuse this body. Neither consumer pays a
//! vtable (`research/shared-eval-substrate.md` §2.1, §2.3 — Phase 4 of epic sq-qonbz).
//!
//! # What lives here vs. stays engine-private
//!
//! The substrate holds the **ordering ALGORITHM**: the SPARQL class precedence
//! (error/unbound < blank < IRI < literal < triple-term), the **kind-first** literal
//! order (a fixed [`LiteralKind`] precedence between literal kinds — the sq-wjl8i
//! total-order fix — with the numeric / strict-typed / string-fallback arms WITHIN a
//! kind), and the recursive component-wise triple-term order. It deliberately does **not** hoist the
//! engine's `Value` enum, its `LitKind` literal-family classifier, or its
//! `value_compare_strict` typed/temporal comparison: those are reused by the engine's
//! relational `<` / `>` / `=` operators too (not only the ORDER BY total order), and
//! are tightly coupled to `oxrdf::Term`, so they stay engine-resident and are surfaced
//! to this algorithm through the trait's [`strict_cmp`](CompareTerm::strict_cmp) /
//! [`as_f64`](CompareTerm::as_f64) hooks. This is the same "generic seam" the `join`
//! kernels use for `JoinKeys` and `numeric` uses for `Num`: the shared *algorithm* is
//! generic over a small abstraction the consumer implements, monomorphised at the call
//! site.
//!
//! # Zero-overhead intent (the load-bearing contract)
//!
//! [`compare_terms`] is generic over `T: CompareTerm` — a **generic type parameter**,
//! NOT a trait object. There is NO `Box<dyn>` / `&dyn` / vtable between the algorithm
//! and the term observations it makes; the compiler emits one specialised, inlinable
//! body per call site. Every item carries `#[inline]`; the structural `no-dyn-dispatch`
//! gate (`scripts/check-no-dyn-dispatch.py`) lists this file in its hot-path set. The
//! original extraction (sq-vezew) was behaviour-identical to the engine's
//! `compare_values`; sq-wjl8i then DELIBERATELY changed the order itself (kind-first
//! literals, exact mixed-tier ties, NaN totalised) to fix three machine-checked
//! intransitivity witnesses — see [`compare_terms`] for what is spec-mandated vs. a
//! documented extension. The fast paths (class ranks, the numeric `partial_cmp`) are
//! unchanged; the exact/lexical work still happens only on cold tie/fallback branches.

//     KINDS (`transitivity_mixed_literal_kinds_incl_nan`, NaN included — the law the
//     sq-sqtk2.4 witnesses proved FALSE before the sq-wjl8i fix): exact-integer literals
//     INCLUDING the 2^53 f64-collapse straddle, double literals, string literals,
//     strict/temporal literals, the full mixed literal-kind domain, a collapse-free
//     exact/inexact numeric mix, recursive triple terms, the non-literal scalar classes,
//     and a REDUCED int-with-non-literal composition (3 straddle ints × 2-string
//     blanks/IRIs × Err — a stated shrink, see its doc)
//   • WITHIN-CLASS TOTALITY (full literal domain, NaN INCLUDED): same-class pairs always
//     compare `Some`
//   • EXACT-ORDER AGREEMENT: for exact-tier integer pairs, compare_terms equals the exact
//     i128 value order even where the f64 images collapse (THE guarantee the `exact_cmp`

// terminate practically. The `for_each_*` kind-dispatch combinators below invert that:
// the symbolic kind CHOICE happens once, in a match whose arms each pass `f` a term with
// a CONCRETE discriminant (only the value index stays symbolic), keeping every dispatch
// leaf linear while the selector still quantifies over all kinds. Additionally, every
// harness carries the SMALLEST `#[kani::unwind]` bound its loops/recursion need (the
// bound also caps the syntactic expansion of `compare_terms`' triple-term recursion,
// which inflates the formula when set high). Under-bounding is LOUD: Kani's unwinding
// assertion fails, so a too-small bound cannot silently weaken a proof.
//
// DOMAIN-COVERAGE SELF-CHECKS (the sq-og8u8 pattern): a re-scoped (shrunk) domain can
// silently drop the very inputs that make a harness adversarial, so each shrunk domain's
// interesting inputs are PINNED by a proof: `domain_exhibits_the_2p53_collapse` pins the
// collapse straddle used by the full `INTS` table, the reduced int-with-non-literal
// domain, and the triple-object domain;
// `domain_cf_numeric_is_collapse_free_with_signed_zero_pair` pins the collapse-free
// mixed range (exact images only) and its ±0.0 equal-but-lexically-distinct pair. If a
// future re-scope silences an interesting input, one of these goes red rather than the
// law harness silently proving less.
//
// HONESTY BOUNDARY (per the bead): this machine-checks the `compare_terms` ALGORITHM over
// the model observation surface `M` below. It is explicitly NOT a claim about the engine's
// `Value` impl of `CompareTerm` in `sparq-engine/src/exec.rs` (that instance stays covered
// by unit + W3C conformance tests; ledgered as the next wave in the design record §6). The
// model is, however, deliberately FAITHFUL to that impl's observation semantics — each trait
// method below documents the `exec.rs` behaviour it mirrors — because a convenient model
// would make these proofs vacuous.
//
// FORMER MACHINE-CHECKED FINDINGS, NOW FIXED (bead sq-wjl8i; the `witness_*` harnesses pin
// the FIXED behaviour and go red on a regression): the sq-sqtk2.4 wave proved the order
// laws did NOT extend across mixed literal KINDS —
//   1. the exact/inexact numeric-tier mix AT the 2^53 collapse boundary was intransitive
//      (the collapsed-f64 fallback tied a double with BOTH straddle integers) — fixed by
//      the exact-rational mixed-tier recheck (`witness_mixed_tier_collapse_now_exact`);
//   2. numeric-vs-plain-string pairs fell to the LEXICAL form, which disagrees with the
//      numeric order (`"10" < "11" < "2"` vs `10 > 2`) — fixed by the kind-first rank:
//      cross-kind pairs order by `LiteralKind`, never by a lexical coercion
//      (`witness_numeric_vs_string_now_ranked_by_kind`);
//   3. NaN made the comparator PARTIAL (`None`, mapped to `Equal` by callers) — fixed by
//      totalising NaN FIRST among numerics (`witness_nan_now_totalised_first`).
// All three were reachable through the engine's real `Value` impl; the engine-side fix
// (`Value::literal_kind`, `Num::cmp_total`, the `cmp_sort_num` sort-cell mirror) is pinned
// by the engine's unit tests and the sparq-reason engine-parity suite.
//
