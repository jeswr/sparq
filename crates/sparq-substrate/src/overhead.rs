//! The **zero-overhead delta** harness: each shared substrate kernel measured
//! against a hand-rolled, pre-extraction equivalent, per the systems paper's §8
//! protocol (`site/papers/sparq-engine-systems.typ` §8, evidence key
//! `substrate.overhead_<kernel>`).
//!
//! # [FABLE-5] sq-atjue — the title-level zero-overhead claim's producing harness
//!
//! The paper's central claim is that "carrying many standards costs no *measured*
//! marginal overhead over the engine's own hand-tuned evaluation". The word
//! *measured* is load-bearing: §8 fixes that the substrate half of the claim is a
//! micro-benchmark of "the shared kernel versus the engine's pre-extraction
//! hand-tuned loops, per kernel, on the canonical host". This module is that
//! micro-benchmark.
//!
//! ## What it measures — and what the number MEANS
//!
//! For each kernel the harness times two implementations over the *same* input:
//!
//! - the **substrate** kernel exactly as the engine (and a future reasoner) call
//!   it — the monomorphic-over-`Id=u32`, no-`Box<dyn>`, `#[inline]` free function
//!   from [`crate::join`] / [`crate::numeric`] / [`crate::compare`], driven through
//!   its generalisation surface: the `JoinKeys` column descriptor, the generic
//!   `Budget` cooperative-cancel type parameter, and the `CompareTerm` trait; and
//! - a **hand-specialised** equivalent written inline right here — the SAME
//!   algorithm and the SAME data structures, but with the generalisation removed:
//!   the key column and combine layout hard-coded to the concrete case, the
//!   `Budget` poll dropped, the `CompareTerm` trait replaced by direct field
//!   access. This is the engine's pre-extraction hand-tuned loop the paper's §5
//!   contrasts against — "whether the *generalised* kernel costs any wall-clock
//!   over the engine's hand-specialised original".
//!
//! The critical methodology rule: the hand-specialised loop runs the **identical
//! algorithm over the identical data structure** as the substrate kernel — a merge
//! join against a merge join, a single-hash `raw_entry` probe against the same
//! probe, a leapfrog intersection against a leapfrog intersection, the `Num` value
//! tower against the `Num` value tower. It removes ONLY the extraction's
//! generalisation layer, never the algorithm. Comparing a kernel against a
//! *different, cheaper* algorithm (e.g. a WCOJ against a nested-loop count) would
//! measure an algorithm gap, not the extraction overhead, and would be dishonest —
//! so this harness deliberately does not do that.
//!
//! The reported [`Kernel::overhead_ratio`] is the fractional wall-clock delta of
//! the shared kernel over the hand-rolled one:
//!
//! ```text
//! overhead_ratio = (substrate_ns - handrolled_ns) / handrolled_ns
//! ```
//!
//! The zero-overhead contract (`research/shared-eval-substrate.md` §2.3, §4) is
//! that the extraction is **shared by source, monomorphised per call site, no
//! vtable between the probe and the comparison** — so the shared kernel and the
//! hand-rolled loop should compile to the same hot loop and the ratio should sit
//! at zero within measurement noise. This harness does **not** assert that; it
//! *measures* it. If a kernel shows a non-negligible positive overhead, the honest
//! disposition — fixed in the paper before the measurement — is to report it as
//! measured and re-scope the "zero-overhead" language to the measured bound, never
//! to bend the number to the claim.
//!
//! ## Honesty boundaries
//!
//! - A wall-clock ratio is only meaningful on a **quiet, dedicated host**. The
//!   emitted envelope carries an `environment` field; a headline number is only
//!   valid when `environment == "canonical"` (a dedicated quiet EC2 box, one
//!   process, min-of-K). A work-box run is `environment == "indicative"` and can
//!   never be cited as the paper headline.
//! - The overhead of a *single* kernel is a ratio of two nanosecond timings, both
//!   subject to the same per-iteration overhead (clock read, black-box fence), so a
//!   tiny per-op kernel's ratio is noisier than a bulk kernel's. The harness reports
//!   the raw substrate/hand-rolled nanoseconds alongside every ratio so a reader can
//!   judge the signal, and it takes the **min of K reps** (the standard robust
//!   estimator for the fastest uncontended path).
//! - The harness is **behaviour-checked, not just timed**: each kernel's two
//!   implementations must produce the *same* result (row count / accumulated value
//!   / order), asserted every rep. A fast-but-wrong hand-rolled loop cannot flatter
//!   the ratio — see [`Kernel::agree`].
