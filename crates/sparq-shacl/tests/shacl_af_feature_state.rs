//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-bif.10) Feature-state coverage for the SHACL Advanced Features
//! (`shacl-af`) surface — the part the bead calls out as unmet: `src/rules.rs`
//! had only inline `#[cfg(test)]` tests (which compile and run ONLY with the
//! feature on), so the AGENTS.md "tests in BOTH feature states" standard was not
//! met for the rule + expression surface.
//!
//! This file is intentionally NOT feature-gated, so it compiles and runs in both
//! states. It pins two load-bearing invariants:
//!
//!   * **Default (feature OFF)** — the rule/expression surface is cleanly compiled
//!     out. A shape carrying `sh:rule` validates with the base [`validate`] path
//!     without the rule firing and without a panic (rules are an inference step,
//!     never part of `validate`), and a `sh:expression`-bearing shape that *would*
//!     be a violation with the feature on instead conforms (the constraint
//!     component is not compiled in). The no-rule-firing assertions hold REGARDLESS
//!     of feature, so they run in both states; the "expression compiled out" vs
//!     "expression fires" assertions are split per feature so each state pins the
//!     correct behaviour.
//!   * **Feature ON (`--features shacl-af`)** — a representative `sh:rule`
//!     (`sh:TripleRule` + `sh:SPARQLRule`) is exercised end-to-end through the
//!     PUBLIC `apply_rules` / `expand` API (not the crate-internal inline tests),
//!     and a `sh:expression` constraint is exercised through `validate`.
