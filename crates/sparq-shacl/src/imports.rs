//! [FABLE-5] (sq-uz0) Shapes-graph ASSEMBLY (W3C SHACL §§3.1/3.3 (shapes-graph)): `sh:shapesGraph`
//! discovery in the data graph plus the transitive, cycle-guarded `owl:imports`
//! closure of every referenced shapes document, unioned into one shapes
//! [`Graph`].
//!
//! Dereferencing an IRI to a document stays a CALLER concern — this engine never
//! touches the network — via the loader callback (`FnMut(&str) ->
//! Result<Option<Graph>, String>`): `Ok(Some(g))` is the fetched document,
//! `Ok(None)` an honest "I cannot resolve this IRI" (recorded, not fatal —
//! SHACL leaves imports support optional), `Err` a hard failure that aborts
//! resolution. What the library owns is everything callers previously
//! hand-rolled: the traversal order, the dedupe/cycle guard (each IRI is
//! dereferenced at most once), the RDF-merge discipline (blank nodes of each
//! loaded document are standardised apart so labels reused across documents
//! never collapse into one node), and the final union.
