// [OPUS-4.8] MpcBackend trait — abstracts the secret-sharing / MPC primitive.
//! The MPC primitive abstraction. The trait is primitive-agnostic; the first
//! concrete impl is [`crate::shamir::ShamirBackend`] (honest-majority, M3).
//!
//! Architecture refs: §3.1 (secret-sharing families & network model), §4.2
//! (trust & threat model), and decision point **§5.2 Q2** (resolved for v1 =
//! honest-majority; configurable long-term).
//!
//! ## The decision point this trait exists to defer (Q2)
//!
//! The whole MPC primitive choice hinges on the trust model, and the literature
//! splits cleanly (architecture §3.1, §4.2):
//!
//! - **Honest-majority** (e.g. replicated 3PC secret sharing): the performance
//!   sweet spot, and — critically — the ONLY regime in which malicious-secure
//!   query-evaluation correctness (Senate/ORQ) AND authenticated inputs (Dutta,
//!   the attestation pillar) are both demonstrated.
//! - **Dishonest-majority malicious** (SPDZ/MASCOT/Overdrive): the realistic
//!   cross-org model for a hostile-pod federation, but pays expensive
//!   input-independent preprocessing and has NO demonstrated query-eval
//!   correctness in the cited literature.
//!
//! Network model compounds it: secret-sharing wins on LAN, garbled/constant-
//! round wins on WAN (the federated setting). The architecture's honest verdict
//! (§5.3) is that the *viable* first target is honest-majority, LAN/datacenter,
//! small data — and that whether the four-flatmates use case (cooperating
//! holders vs an external landlord) even NEEDS dishonest-majority among holders
//! is itself unresolved.
//!
//! **Therefore this trait commits to NO primitive.** It defines the seam so an
//! honest-majority impl (M3, first) and a dishonest-majority impl (later, if
//! Q2 resolves that way) are swappable without touching the join or proof
//! layers. Convention #7 (modularity is the contribution) demands exactly this.
//!
//! ## Q2 RESOLVED for v1 + how the trust model stays CONFIGURABLE
//!
//! Jesse's decision: **honest-majority for v1, configurable long-term.** The
//! concrete v1 impl is [`crate::shamir::ShamirBackend`] (honest-majority Shamir
//! `t`-of-`n`, semi-honest). The trait keeps that choice swappable:
//!
//! - **Callers select a backend by [`TrustModel`], never by concrete type.** A
//!   federation inspects [`BackendInfo`] and refuses a backend whose guarantees
//!   don't match its threat model. The join/proof layers are written against the
//!   `MpcBackend` trait (e.g. [`crate::join::HiddenValueJoin`] takes *a backend*,
//!   not "Shamir"), so substituting a dishonest-majority impl touches NO caller.
//! - **The associated [`MpcBackend::Share`] type absorbs the scheme change.**
//!   Shamir's share is a per-party polynomial-point vector; a SPDZ-style
//!   dishonest-majority backend's share is an *authenticated* additive share
//!   (value + MAC tag) with a preprocessing (triples) phase. Both hide behind
//!   `type Share`, so the difference never leaks into the join/proof signatures.
//! - **What a dishonest-majority (SPDZ/MASCOT/Overdrive) backend would add, all
//!   BEHIND this trait:** (1) an input-independent preprocessing step producing
//!   Beaver triples + MACs (a private step, not a trait change); (2) `run_secure`
//!   consuming triples for multiplications and tracking MACs; (3)
//!   `reconstruct_disclosed` doing a MAC-check before opening (abort on cheat →
//!   guarantee (D), malicious security). It reports
//!   `TrustModel::DishonestMajority` + a non-`SemiHonestOnly`
//!   [`MaliciousSecurity`] via [`BackendInfo`]. Crucially the
//!   `share_private_input` / `run_secure` /
//!   `reconstruct_disclosed` SIGNATURES are unchanged, so
//!   [`crate::join::HiddenValueJoin`] and the future collaborative-proof layer
//!   compose onto it unmodified.
//!
//! No trust model is hardcoded into the join/protocol layer: it is a property of
//! the chosen `MpcBackend` value, surfaced via [`BackendInfo`].

// =============================================================================
// [OPUS-4.8] sq-mq8q — THREE-AXIS SECURITY DESCRIPTOR (Fable unavailable;
// re-review when Fable returns).
//
// Background: the original two enums ([`TrustModel`] + [`MaliciousSecurity`])
// FLATTENED what the literature treats as THREE genuinely-orthogonal axes
// (research/mpc-security-models-and-benchmarks.md §1.2). `TrustModel` was a
// *binary* take on the corruption-threshold axis (it lost the n/3-vs-n/2 split
// that separates perfect-GOD from statistical-GOD), and `MaliciousSecurity`
// BUNDLED the adversary axis (semi-honest vs active) WITH the output-guarantee
// axis (abort vs robust) AND soldered "HonestMajority" into the *variant names*
// — so dishonest-majority-malicious-abort (= the SPDZ regime) was UNNAMEABLE,
// and covert / identifiable-vs-unanimous abort had NO representation.
//
// This module replaces that flattening with three orthogonal axes
// ([`AdversaryModel`], [`OutputGuarantee`], [`CorruptionThreshold`]) plus a
// [`PublicVerifiability`] marker, composed into a [`SecurityDescriptor`].
// Cleve's impossibility (STOC'86 — fairness/GOD is impossible without an honest
// majority) is encoded as a TYPE-LEVEL INVARIANT: the stronger output
// guarantees are only constructible under an honest-majority threshold (see
// [`OutputGuarantee::fairness`] / [`OutputGuarantee::guaranteed_output`], which
// are the ONLY way to build those variants and which take the threshold as
// proof of honest majority). The old [`MaliciousSecurity`] enum and the
// [`BackendInfo::malicious_security`] field are KEPT as a back-compat
// PROJECTION (see [`SecurityDescriptor::malicious_security`]) so
// `ShamirBackend::info()` and every existing `BackendInfo` caller still compile
// unchanged. Guarantees are reported PER-OPERATOR ([`OperatorClass`] /
// [`MpcBackend::operator_security`]) because they genuinely differ — the
// degree-`t` aggregate is robust while the degree-`2t` equality open is
// semi-honest-only at `n = 2t+1`, and one backend-level bit would lie.
//
// Scope: this is a CONTROLLED enum refactor behind the unchanged `MpcBackend`
// trait, NOT a rewrite. The fail-closed selection registry that consumes these
// axes is a SEPARATE concern — tracked as bead sq-a6p1 (depends on this).

// =============================================================================
// [OPUS-4.8] sq-a6p1 — SECURITY-MODEL SELECTION / NEGOTIATION API + a FAIL-CLOSED
// backend registry (Fable unavailable; re-review when Fable returns).
//
// Background: sq-mq8q (above) gave every backend a three-axis
// [`SecurityDescriptor`] and per-operator reporting, but a caller could only
// inspect a chosen backend's [`BackendInfo`] *post-hoc*. There was no way for a
// federation to state its security requirement UP FRONT and have a backend
// MATCHED against it — and, crucially, no way for an over-strong request (e.g.
// dishonest-majority-malicious over the SPARQL pipeline, which NO shipped backend
// can honour — research §1.3 honesty-anchor (e)) to be *truthfully refused*
// instead of silently downgraded onto the one semi-honest Shamir backend.
//
// This module adds exactly that, the "configurable long-term" deliverable from
// research §1.3(b): a [`SecurityRequirement`] (the federation's stated floor on
// each axis + the attribution / public-verifiability flags), its
// [`SecurityRequirement::satisfies`] predicate against a [`BackendInfo`], and a
// [`BackendRegistry`] whose [`BackendRegistry::select`] returns the STRONGEST
// registered backend meeting the requirement or, FAILING CLOSED, the typed
// [`MpcError::NoBackendSatisfies`] — mirroring the crate's
// [`MpcError::NotYetImplemented`] honesty discipline (no fake crypto; here, no
// fake security level). It composes with the existing descriptor + per-operator
// reporting: [`BackendRegistry::select_for_operator`] matches against
// [`MpcBackend::operator_security`] so the degree-`2t` equality open is judged on
// ITS guarantee, not the backend's headline degree-`t` aggregate bit.
//
// Scope (sq-a6p1): stays in `backend.rs` + the one new `MpcError` variant. The
// registry is GENERIC over a concrete backend type `B: MpcBackend` rather than
// `&dyn MpcBackend` (as the research sketch wrote it) because [`MpcBackend`] has
// an associated `Share` type and is therefore NOT object-safe — a `dyn` form
// would force every backend in one registry to share one `Share`, which is
// exactly the cross-scheme heterogeneity a federation does NOT have at v1 (it
// runs ONE scheme family). Generic-over-`B` is the honest, compiling shape.
