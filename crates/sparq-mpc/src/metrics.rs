// [OPUS-4.8] sq-sxm — deterministic MPC communication / round / multiplication
// counter for the IN-PROCESS counting tier (Tier 1). New module; instruments at
// call sites added by the benchmark harness, NOT by rewriting backend.rs /
// shamir.rs / oblivious.rs internals (those are owned by sibling beads sq-a6p1 /
// sq-jnkm). The counter is analytic: it records the communication a REAL
// deployment of the same protocol structure would pay, derived from (n, t, sizes)
// — exactly the "counted, not timed" metric the design record prescribes
// (research/mpc-security-models-and-benchmarks.md §5.2).
//! Deterministic communication / round / multiplication accounting for the
//! in-process MPC simulation.
//!
//! ## Why a counter and not a timer
//!
//! `sparq-mpc` is a single-process multi-party *simulation*: every "party" is a
//! function call, so there is NO network, NO round latency, NO bytes on the wire.
//! A single-process wall-clock therefore does NOT measure MPC cost and must never
//! masquerade as one (design record §5, the critical-honesty constraint). The
//! load-bearing, cross-`N`-meaningful metric is the **modelled communication**:
//! how many field elements cross the abstract party boundary, in how many logical
//! rounds, paying how many secure multiplications.
//!
//! These quantities are *deterministic functions of `(n, t, sizes)`* — the same
//! input always yields the same counts (load-robust; unlike a quiet-box-sensitive
//! timing). This module is the accumulator; [`crate::bench`] is the harness that
//! drives the representative operations across the (security model × N × query
//! class) matrix and reads these counters off.
//!
//! ## What is counted (the metric triple + multiplications)
//!
//! Per the design record's metric definitions (§5.2):
//!
//! - **`field_elements_opened`** — each field element reconstructed (opened) across
//!   the parties. The aggregate opens 1 (the sum); each `secure_equal` opens 1 (the
//!   masked product `d·r`). This is the dominant on-wire term.
//! - **`field_elements_shared`** — each field element distributed when a secret is
//!   dealt (one share per party leaves the dealer). Sharing one secret across `n`
//!   parties sends `n` field elements (`n − 1` to the other parties; we count the
//!   full `n` as the abstract boundary-crossings, then derive a per-party figure).
//! - **`multiplications`** — secure (degree-raising) multiplications. Linear ops
//!   (add/sub/scale, the aggregate's cumulative sum) are LOCAL and free → 0. Each
//!   `secure_equal` pays exactly 1; the oblivious shuffle/sort cost is taken from
//!   the crate's own [`crate::oblivious::ShuffleCost`] / [`crate::oblivious::SortCost`].
//! - **`mult_rounds`** / **`open_rounds`** — logical communication rounds. A linear
//!   aggregate is `0` mult rounds `+ 1` open. Each `secure_equal` is `1` mult round
//!   `+ 1` open. An all-pairs join is `|L|·|R|` such tests. (Independent tests can
//!   batch into the same round on a real network — the harness records BOTH the
//!   sequential round count and a batched lower bound so neither over- nor
//!   under-states the round structure.)
//!
//! ## Bytes-per-party derivation
//!
//! A canonical field element is `Fp` over `p = 2^61 − 1`, i.e. it serialises to
//! **8 bytes** ([`FIELD_BYTES`]; one `u64`-width limb). The design record fixes
//! "each `F_p` opened = 8 bytes/party" (§5.2). So `bytes_per_party` for an open is
//! `field_elements_opened × 8` (each party broadcasts its one share to recombine);
//! for a deal it is `8` per secret per recipient party. See [`CommCounter::bytes_per_party`].

/// Serialised width of one canonical [`crate::field::Fp`] element, in bytes. `Fp`
/// is over the Mersenne prime `p = 2^61 − 1`, whose canonical representative fits one `u64`
/// limb, so the on-wire encoding is **8 bytes** — the per-party-per-open cost the
/// design record fixes (§5.2: "each `F_p` opened = 8 bytes/party"). Deriving it
/// from `size_of::<u64>()` keeps the figure tied to the representation rather than
/// a hard-coded literal. `[OPUS-4.8]`
pub const FIELD_BYTES: usize = {
    // Compile-time assertion that the field value fits one u64 limb (so the
    // 8-byte wire width is correct). `Fp::value()` returns `u64`.
    assert!(crate::field::P < u64::MAX);
    std::mem::size_of::<u64>()
};

/// A deterministic accumulator of the communication a REAL deployment of the
/// simulated protocol would pay. All fields are monotone counters; the same
/// protocol over the same `(n, t, sizes)` always produces the same values.
///
/// This is threaded through the harness's instrumented wrappers (see
/// [`crate::bench`]); it deliberately lives OUTSIDE the protocol primitives so the
/// counting tier adds no invasive edits to `shamir.rs` / `backend.rs` /
/// `oblivious.rs` (sibling-bead ownership). `[OPUS-4.8]`
