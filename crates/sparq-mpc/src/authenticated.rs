// [OPUS-4.8] sq-km34.1: IT-MAC authenticated secret sharing — the FOUNDATION for
// honest-majority malicious-with-abort MPC. Layered over the existing degree-t
// Shamir sharing (`crate::shamir`). This module is the CARRIER (the `[[x]]` pair
// + the free linear ops); the MAC-carrying multiplication (sq-km34.3,
// `MacSession::auth_mul`) and the batched MAC-check (sq-km34.4,
// `MacSession::mac_check`) live in `crate::shamir`, and the registry wiring
// (sq-km34.7) is a SEPARATE bead that has NOT landed.
//! Authenticated (IT-MAC) secret sharing over the honest-majority Shamir backend
//! — the foundation of malicious-with-abort security.
//!
//! Design (authoritative): `research/mpc-malicious-security-design.md` §2.1–2.2
//! (the construction) and §2.3 (free linear ops). Skill `mpc-protocols`:
//! "malicious security comes free in honest majority" (Goyal–Song eprint
//! 2020/134) for *linear* circuits — which is exactly what this foundation
//! delivers; the cost only appears at multiplication (sq-km34.2+).
//!
//! ## What this is (§2.1–2.2)
//!
//! The SPDZ-family fix for the crate's load-bearing semi-honest assumptions
//! (design doc §1, "the honest hole") is to attach an **information-theoretic
//! MAC** to every secret-shared value. Pick a single, **session-global** MAC key
//! `α ∈ F_p` that is *itself* secret-shared as a degree-`t` Shamir sharing
//! `[α]` — **no party knows `α`** (design §2.1). The authenticated sharing of a
//! secret `x` is then the pair
//!
//! ```text
//! [[x]] = ( [x] , [α·x] )      both degree-t Shamir sharings.
//! ```
//!
//! `m_x = α·x` is the authenticator: a party cannot change its share of `[x]` to
//! flip `x` *and* simultaneously fix `[m_x]` to still equal `α·x`, because it does
//! not know `α`. That is the whole point — and it is why the later batched
//! MAC-check (sq-km34.4) catches tampering even at the minimal `n = 2t+1` where
//! Reed–Solomon redundancy is zero (design §2.5): soundness comes from the
//! *secret* `α`, not from over-determination of the codeword.
//!
//! ## What this foundation bead delivers — and what it deliberately does NOT
//!
//! This is bead **sq-km34.1**, the FOUNDATION (design §6 step 1). It delivers:
//!
//! - [`MacKey`] — the session-global secret-shared `[α]`, minted by the dealer,
//!   structurally **un-openable** (no method reconstructs `α`; see below).
//! - [`AuthenticatedShare`] — the `([x], [α·x])` pair (design §2.2).
//! - [`ShamirDealer::new_mac_session`](crate::shamir::ShamirDealer::new_mac_session)
//!   mints `[α]` once per session and returns a
//!   [`MacSession`](crate::shamir::MacSession) whose
//!   [`authenticated_share`](crate::shamir::MacSession::authenticated_share)
//!   produces authenticated sharings under that key.
//! - The **free linear ops** [`auth_add`], [`auth_scale`], [`auth_sub`],
//!   [`auth_add_constant`] (design §2.3): each applies the existing local Shamir
//!   linear op to BOTH `[x]` and `[α·x]`, with the public-constant MAC term using
//!   the shared `[α]`. Zero communication rounds — the honest-majority sweet spot.
//!
//! It does **NOT** itself deliver (they live elsewhere, or have not landed):
//!
//! - MAC-carrying **multiplication** + authenticated degree-reduce — **sq-km34.3**
//!   (design §2.4 route (a)). Multiplication is where authentication needs real
//!   work (`α·(x·y) ≠ (α·x)·(α·y)`); this module only covers the FREE linear ops.
//!   It HAS landed, in `crate::shamir` as
//!   [`MacSession::auth_mul`](crate::shamir::MacSession::auth_mul): the value
//!   product and the MAC `[α·z] = reduce([α·x]·[y])` are two INDEPENDENT
//!   mult-then-reduce rounds, which is what MAC-covers the `degree_reduce`
//!   re-sharing (design "Hole 2").
//! - The **batched MAC-check** at open time — **sq-km34.4** (design §2.5). Without
//!   it an authenticated share is not tamper-*evident*; this module builds the
//!   carrier, not the check. It HAS landed, in `crate::shamir` as
//!   [`MacSession::mac_check`](crate::shamir::MacSession::mac_check).
//! - **Registry / per-operator** reporting (`new_malicious`, and any descriptor
//!   that reports an active-security tier) — **sq-km34.7** (design §4), which has
//!   NOT landed, and which is gated behind `sq-qhy4` external sign-off: no
//!   descriptor may report a tier the back-compat `malicious_security` projection
//!   would read back as active security until that gate closes. This module does
//!   NOT touch [`crate::backend`], and the security tier
//!   [`crate::backend`] reports to a federation is still the semi-honest one: a
//!   caller only gets the authenticated guarantee by explicitly running the
//!   `MacSession` path and calling `mac_check` before it acts on an opened value.
//!
//! ## Security tier (stated, not over-claimed)
//!
//! This foundation is the carrier for **honest-majority, malicious-with-abort**
//! security (design §3, "the achieved tier"). On its own it changes NO advertised
//! guarantee: it adds the MAC sharing alongside the value sharing and keeps the
//! linear ops free and correct. The malicious-security PROPERTY materialises only
//! on a path where the multiplication carries the MAC
//! ([`MacSession::auth_mul`](crate::shamir::MacSession::auth_mul), sq-km34.3) AND
//! the batched check
//! ([`MacSession::mac_check`](crate::shamir::MacSession::mac_check), sq-km34.4)
//! fires before any opened value is acted on. Both have landed, so that path
//! EXISTS — but it is opt-in: on any path that does not run it (the plain
//! [`ShamirBackend`](crate::shamir::ShamirBackend) aggregate, the semi-honest
//! join/compare surfaces) the parties are still trusted to follow the protocol,
//! and the backend's advertised tier is unchanged pending sq-km34.7. Nothing here
//! is externally audited (sq-qhy4); MPC remains research-grade.
//!
//! ## Why `α` is NEVER reconstructed (a structural, not documentary, guarantee)
//!
//! [`MacKey`] holds `[α]` only as its per-party [`Share`] vector and exposes NO
//! method that opens it — not `reconstruct`, not a getter that returns the field
//! value, nothing. The crate's reconstruction entry points
//! ([`ShamirBackend::reconstruct`](crate::shamir::ShamirBackend::reconstruct),
//! [`reconstruct_degree`](crate::shamir::reconstruct_degree),
//! [`reconstruct_robust`](crate::robust::reconstruct_robust)) all take `&[Share]`,
//! so `[α]`'s shares COULD be fed to them by external code that pulls them out —
//! which is why [`MacKey`] keeps its shares private and the only share-level
//! accessor (`MacKey::scaled_constant_mac`, crate-private) returns a *derived*
//! sharing of `α·c` for a PUBLIC `c` (the §2.3 add-constant MAC term), never
//! `[α]` itself.
//! The cleartext session `α` is RETAINED (secret, in-process) inside the
//! [`MacSession`](crate::shamir::MacSession) for the session's lifetime — it must
//! be, to mint each value's MAC `α·x` — but it is never returned to, nor opened by,
//! any caller (see
//! [`ShamirDealer::new_mac_session`](crate::shamir::ShamirDealer::new_mac_session)).
//! What is never reconstructed is the *shared* `[α]` and the MAC shares `[α·x]`.
//! A test (`mac_key_is_never_reconstructed_*`) pins that no `α`-opening path
//! exists. `[OPUS-4.8]`
