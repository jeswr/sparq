// [OPUS-4.8] sq-2fms: federation-level OWA / omission negative suite. Written
// while Fable unavailable — re-review on return.
//! Federation-level Open-World-Assumption (OWA) / omission negative suite
//! (sq-2fms).
//!
//! Architecture §2 convention #8 (OWA-safe semantics) and §4.2 require that an
//! *omission* — a holder dropping a graph, returning a truncated partial, or
//! omitting a row/contributor — must **not forge a valid result**, and that a
//! short-count / dropped-graph view should be *detectable*. The intended
//! cryptographic defence is the issuer-signed true-triple-count + salt of §4.3
//! step 1 (a holder commits to HOW MANY true facts it holds, so a short count is
//! caught against the signed bound). That binding is **gated on M4** (the
//! collaborative proof + attestation, see [`crate::proof`]) — it does NOT exist
//! yet, and this suite does not pretend it does.
//!
//! So this module pins the ACTUAL pre-M4 behaviour along two honest axes, exactly
//! as the bead asks:
//!
//! 1. **Omission cannot FORGE.** Whatever a malicious/faulty holder omits, the
//!    federated disclosed result it can produce is always a SUBSET of (or equal
//!    to) the honest result over the data that was actually contributed — it can
//!    never manufacture a binding, a row, or a join that no holder's data
//!    supports. This is the part that IS guaranteed today, and it is the security-
//!    relevant half: omission degrades *completeness*, never *soundness*. The
//!    disclosed-key join is a faithful inner join over the partials it is GIVEN
//!    (`join.rs` doc: "join == union-store evaluation"), so a dropped input simply
//!    shrinks `D = ⋃ contributed graphs`; the result still satisfies
//!    `Disclosed(π) ⊆ Eval_PAG(Q, D_contributed)`.
//!
//! 2. **Omission is NOT YET cryptographically DETECTABLE (the honest gap).** With
//!    no signed-count binding (pre-M4) the federation has no way to tell a
//!    genuinely-empty holder from a holder that DROPPED its rows: both present an
//!    empty/short partial, and both are accepted. The ONLY thing that surfaces a
//!    short-count today is the out-of-band **differential-vs-union-store** anchor
//!    (`pipeline.rs` / `join.rs` differential tests) — i.e. a verifier who already
//!    knows the true union. We pin that the discrepancy is *visible in the
//!    differential* (so the test is a real regression guard for when the signed-
//!    count defence lands) while it is *invisible to the protocol itself*. We do
//!    NOT claim detection the code cannot deliver — that would be fake crypto.
//!
//! Each test therefore asserts the real behaviour and labels which half it is.
//! When the §4.3-step-1 signed-count binding lands (M4), the "not yet detectable"
//! pins here become the failing red tests that drive its acceptance.
