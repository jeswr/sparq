// [OPUS-4.8] sq-6y92 — the end-to-end federated MPC pipeline driver: the GLUE
// that composes holder → share → join → secure-threshold → reconstruct →
// ProofStatement into ONE worked federated response for the four-flatmates use case.
//! The end-to-end federated MPC pipeline driver (architecture §4.3 steps 1–6).
//!
//! Everything below COMPOSES the existing primitives — it invents no crypto. The
//! pieces already exist in isolation ([`crate::holder`], [`crate::shamir`],
//! [`crate::join`], [`crate::compare`], [`crate::proof`]) and are individually
//! tested; what was missing — and what this module supplies — is the *driver*
//! that runs them as one federated response for the driving **four-flatmates**
//! scenario (architecture §2; Wright CEUR Vol-4085).
//!
//! ## The worked scenario (architecture §4.3 steps 1–6)
//!
//! Four flatmates share one flat. Each holds an issuer-signed credential carrying
//! (a) a PUBLIC, disclosed global-IRI fact — they are a member of the SAME flat
//! `ex:flat` — and (b) a PRIVATE salary that must NEVER leave the holder. A
//! landlord (the verifier) asks one federated question:
//!
//! - *Which credential-holders are members of `ex:flat`?* (a disclosed-key join
//!   over the global IRI — answerable in the clear, convention #4), AND
//! - *Is the flat's cumulative salary `> £100k`?* (a secure threshold over the
//!   per-holder private salaries that opens ONLY the verdict bit — the exact
//!   total is never reconstructed, disclosure-minimisation).
//!
//! The driver runs all six §4.3 steps:
//!
//! 1. **Holders** ([`crate::holder::Holder`]) — each flatmate's wallet is its own
//!    [`sparq_core::Graph`]; raw graphs never leave (§4.2 minimise sharing).
//! 2. **Share / evaluate** — the PRIVATE salary of each holder is secret-shared
//!    via the Shamir backend ([`MpcBackend::share_private_input`]),
//!    while the DISCLOSED membership fact is evaluated locally
//!    ([`crate::holder::Holder::evaluate_local`]).
//! 3. **Join** ([`crate::join::DisclosedKeyJoin`]) — fold the disclosed-key joins
//!    over the global-IRI key. **The driver decides PER-OPERATOR disclosed-vs-
//!    hidden routing** ([`OperatorRouting`], RQ2a): the membership IRIs join in
//!    the clear; the salary values stay secret-shared and route into the MPC.
//! 4. **Secure aggregate + threshold** — [`MpcBackend::run_secure`]
//!    sums the hidden salary shares (free local addition), then
//!    [`crate::compare::disclose_threshold_verdict`] opens ONLY the `> £100k` bit
//!    (secure-threshold, sq-rrz4) — the exact sum is never an output.
//! 5. **Reconstruct** — the disclosed federated join result (the membership
//!    multiset) is the disclosed answer alongside the verdict bit.
//! 6. **ProofStatement** ([`crate::proof::ProofStatement`]) — assemble a REAL
//!    statement whose `disclosed_result` is byte-equal to a plaintext union-store
//!    evaluation of the SAME federated query. `proof.prove` STAYS the honest
//!    [`MpcError::NotYetImplemented`] stub (this glue is crypto-free + fork-
//!    invariant to Q1/Q2); the driver assembles the statement STRUCTURE with the
//!    real disclosed result — it does NOT fake a proof.
//!
//! ## Per-operator disclosed-vs-hidden routing (RQ2a) — the load-bearing decision
//!
//! §4.3 step 3 says: decide PER OPERATOR what is disclosed vs hidden. This driver
//! makes that decision explicit and inspectable in [`FederatedResponse::routing`]:
//!
//! - The **membership join** is over a global IRI (§2 convention #6) whose
//!   bound values are DISCLOSED, so it is a crypto-free plaintext equi-join
//!   OUTSIDE the cryptographic core ([`crate::join::DisclosedKeyJoin`], convention
//!   #4). Routed `Disclosed`.
//! - The **salary aggregate + threshold** is over PRIVATE per-source values that
//!   must never leave a source, so it enters the MPC: secret-shared sum
//!   ([`MpcBackend::run_secure`]) then a secure comparison that
//!   opens only the verdict ([`crate::compare`]). Routed `Hidden`.
//!
//! The routing is data the (untrusted, §4.1) planner produces; the driver does
//! not trust it for *soundness* (the disclosed-key join independently re-checks
//! the key is present, and the differential-vs-union-store test is the
//! correctness anchor), only as the hint for WHICH protocol each operator runs.
//!
//! ## Security tier (stated, not papered over)
//!
//! Honest-majority, semi-honest — exactly [`crate::shamir::ShamirBackend`]'s tier,
//! inherited unchanged (the driver adds no new crypto assumption). The threshold
//! comparison is reported [`crate::backend::OperatorClass::Comparison`] (semi-
//! honest-only); the disclosed-key join is crypto-free. Malicious hardening
//! (IT-MACs / verifiable resharing) and the collaborative ZK proof (Q1, M4) are
//! the SAME deferred seams the rest of the crate documents — see
//! [`FederatedResponse::statement`] / [`crate::proof`].
