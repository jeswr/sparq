// [OPUS-4.8] sq-py8h.5 — planner guard + cost-model wiring for the HIDDEN-regime
// bounded property-path operator. Rejects statically-large unrolls, REFUSES a
// hidden UNBOUNDED path fail-closed via `MpcError::NoBackendSatisfies` (never a
// silent default-`k` approximation), and emits the operator's modelled
// communication cost (k×-join + O(k) reduction rounds + B-slot output) through the
// crate's `CommCounter` so the matrix runner counts it (never a fabricated
// wall-clock).
//! Planner guard + cost model for the hidden bounded property-path operator
//! (`sq-py8h.5`, design §1.1/§4.3/§5/§6).
//!
//! The cryptographic operator itself lives in the parent module
//! ([`super::eval_bounded_path_hidden`] / [`super::eval_exact_k_chain_hidden`]).
//! This file is the **planner-facing** layer that a query planner consults BEFORE
//! it asks the operator to run, plus the **cost descriptor** the benchmark matrix
//! reads off. It performs no crypto and touches no secret key — every decision is
//! a closed-form function of the PUBLIC plan parameters (the bound `k`, the
//! alternation arity `a`, the public edge count `|E|`, and the public padded
//! output bound `B`; design §1.2/§4.1).
//!
//! ## (a) Statically-large unroll → rejected
//!
//! A repetition `(step){m,k}` over an `a`-way alternation enumerates
//! `Σ_ℓ (a^ℓ · |E|^ℓ)` edge-tuples — exponential in the PUBLIC bound `k`. The
//! operator already rejects an over-[`super::MAX_CHAIN_TUPLES`] unroll inside
//! `check_bounded_params`;
//! [`plan_hidden_bounded_path`](crate::hidden_path::planner::plan_hidden_bounded_path)
//! surfaces that SAME guard at
//! plan time so a planner can reject (or warn on) the path before dispatching it,
//! and [`BoundedPathPlan::warn`](crate::hidden_path::planner::BoundedPathPlan::warn)
//! flags a path that is *admissible* but heavy
//! (within reach of the cap) so a caller can choose to refuse it under a tighter
//! dataset cap — the same df/dataset-cap discipline the benchmarks use.
//!
//! ## (b) Hidden UNBOUNDED path → refused fail-closed (NOT approximated)
//!
//! A hidden `(p)+` / `(p)*` / `(p){m,}` has NO finite public bound. There is no
//! sound way to evaluate it in this regime: the transitive closure over a SECRET
//! graph has secret depth, and silently substituting a default `k` would return a
//! WRONG answer the verifier could not recompute (the bound must be explicit AND
//! public — design §1.1/§1.2). So a request carrying an
//! [`PathUpperBound::Open`](crate::hidden_path::planner::PathUpperBound::Open)
//! upper bound is REFUSED through the registry's fail-closed channel,
//! [`MpcError::NoBackendSatisfies`] (the negotiation-layer "no backend can do
//! this"), exactly as a dishonest-majority-malicious request is refused — never
//! downgraded to a weaker/approximate answer.
//!
//! ## (c) Cost wired into [`crate::metrics::CommCounter`]
//!
//! [`BoundedPathPlan::comm_counter`](crate::hidden_path::planner::BoundedPathPlan::comm_counter)
//! folds the operator's modelled cost into a
//! `CommCounter`: the per-tuple secure equalities (the `k×`-join — `Σ_ℓ` over the
//! enumerated tuples of `ℓ−1` internal-hop equalities each), the `O(k)`-depth
//! AND/OR reduction rounds those chain through, and the `B`-slot oblivious output
//! (select multiplications + opens + the shuffle over `B` slots). The benchmark
//! matrix ([`crate::bench`]) reads this counter for its
//! [`crate::bench::QueryClass::HiddenBoundedPath`] cell, so the operator's cost is
//! COUNTED structurally — never a fabricated wall-clock (design §5, the
//! counted-not-timed constraint).
