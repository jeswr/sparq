// [OPUS-4.8] sq-dwb5: batched / vector secret sharing — generalise the
// single-scalar `share_private_input` to a holder sharing a `Vec<Fp>` (per-row
// hidden values / a salary vector / per-graph commitments) under a DOCUMENTED
// row-binding, so the secure aggregate and the hidden-value join can range over
// more than one value per source.
//! Batched (vector) secret sharing + its row-binding contract.
//!
//! Architecture refs: §4.3 step 4 (the secure computation over secret-shared
//! per-source values), §4.2 (minimise inter-source disclosure). Skill
//! `mpc-protocols`: batched secret sharing is the standard way to secure a
//! *column* of private values under one MPC session.
//!
//! ## The gap this closes
//!
//! [`crate::shamir::ShamirBackend::share_private_input`] caps a holder's secure
//! contribution to ONE scalar (one row, one column — its single salary). The
//! four-flatmates aggregate works because each flatmate has exactly one private
//! salary; but the moment a holder has a *column* of private values (per-row
//! hidden join keys, a salary history, a per-graph commitment vector) the single
//! scalar is not enough. This module is the batched primitive: a holder shares a
//! `Vec<Fp>`, and the result carries an EXPLICIT row-binding so downstream
//! operators correlate elements across holders correctly.
//!
//! ## Row-binding contract (READ THIS — it is load-bearing for correctness)
//!
//! A [`BatchedShares`] is an ordered `Vec` of per-element Shamir sharings. The
//! binding of element `i` to a logical row is one of two documented modes,
//! recorded in [`RowBinding`]:
//!
//! - [`RowBinding::Positional`] — element `i` is row `i`. Two holders' batches
//!   correlate by INDEX. This is sound only when both holders impose the SAME
//!   deterministic order on their rows; [`crate::shamir::ShamirBackend::share_private_inputs`]
//!   enforces this by value-sorting before sharing, so positional batches from
//!   different holders line up regardless of local row order. Use for a per-row
//!   secure aggregate where row `i` of holder A pairs with row `i` of holder B
//!   (e.g. element-wise cumulative sum of two equal-length salary vectors).
//! - [`RowBinding::Keyed`] — element `i` is bound to the DISCLOSED row key
//!   `keys[i]` (a public global IRI / row id, convention #6). Correlation across
//!   holders is by KEY, not index, so the orders need not match. The key column
//!   is disclosed (convention #4) and travels alongside the shares; the VALUE
//!   stays hidden. Use when rows are addressed by a public id rather than by
//!   position.
//!
//! Both preserve the single-scalar privacy guarantee element-wise: each element
//! has its own fresh degree-`t` masking polynomial (see
//! [`crate::shamir::ShamirDealer::share_batch`]), so any `≤ t` parties' shares of
//! the WHOLE batch are jointly independent of all the values.
//!
//! ## What is wired end-to-end here
//!
//! - [`BatchedShares`] / [`BatchedAuthShares`] — the carrier + binding metadata.
//! - [`BatchedShares::reconstruct`] — element-wise open (the inverse of sharing).
//! - [`per_row_sum`] — the multi-row secure aggregate: element-wise cumulative
//!   sum across several holders' positional batches, the zero-round Shamir
//!   linear fold lifted to a vector. This is the demonstrated end-to-end
//!   multi-row path (tested against the plaintext per-row sum).
//!
//! The full batched HIDDEN-VALUE join (a [`crate::join::HiddenValueJoin`] ranging
//! over many rows per holder via these batches, with the oblivious output
//! transform of [`crate::oblivious_join`]) is a larger wiring job tracked
//! separately — see the crate's bead tracker (follow-up to sq-dwb5). The
//! primitive + binding it needs is exactly what this module lands.
