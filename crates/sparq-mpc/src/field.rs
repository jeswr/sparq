// [OPUS-4.8] Prime-field arithmetic for Shamir secret sharing (M3).
//! Arithmetic in the prime field `F_p` underpinning Shamir secret sharing.
//!
//! Architecture refs: §3.1 (secret-sharing families), §4.3 step 4 (the secure
//! computation runs over secret-shared values). Honest-majority Shamir requires
//! a field; this module is that field and nothing more — no networking, no
//! sharing logic (that is [`crate::shamir`]).
//!
//! ## Choice of `p`
//!
//! A 61-bit Mersenne prime `p = 2^61 - 1` (the largest Mersenne prime below
//! 2^63). Three reasons:
//! - **Products stay in `u128`.** Two field elements are `< 2^61`, so their
//!   product is `< 2^122`, comfortably inside `u128` — reduction is a couple of
//!   shifts-and-adds, no big-integer dependency. This keeps the crate
//!   dependency-free (no `num-bigint` / `ark-ff` reaching the build graph) which
//!   matters for the native-only / wasm-exclusion invariant.
//! - **Range covers the use case.** Salaries, counts, and 61-bit-truncated IRI
//!   fingerprints all fit under 2^61. The flatmate cumulative-salary aggregate
//!   (four × ~10^5) is six orders of magnitude clear of the modulus, so the
//!   secure sum never wraps and reconstructs to the true integer.
//! - **It is a real prime field**, so Lagrange interpolation (reconstruction)
//!   and the additive/multiplicative structure Shamir relies on are exact — this
//!   is NOT a toy modular-arithmetic stand-in.
//!
//! ## Honesty note
//!
//! This is textbook finite-field arithmetic (Shamir 1979; standard MPC field
//! ops). It is the *correct* substrate for honest-majority Shamir. It is not, by
//! itself, a security claim: security comes from the sharing scheme + threshold
//! ([`crate::shamir`]) under the honest-majority semi-honest model stated there.
