// [OPUS-4.8] sq-7leq: encode the witness-validation-before-proving TEST
// OBLIGATION for the collaborative-proof (coZK) path. Written while Fable
// unavailable — re-review on return. This module ENCODES an obligation against
// an admittedly NOT-sound area (sq-qhy4 single-prover audit; sq-9hrn coZK
// re-audit); it does NOT claim the collaborative path is sound.
//! Witness-validation-before-proving obligation for the collaborative-proof path
//! (bead **sq-7leq**, derived from `research/mpc-cozk-reaudit.md` §3, bead
//! **sq-9hrn**).
//!
//! ## What this encodes — and why it is honest, not a soundness claim
//!
//! The coZK re-audit against CRYPTO'25 eprint 2025/1026 (Garg–Goel–Jain–
//! Roberts–Sekar) surfaced a NEGATIVE RESULT for the *intended* collaborative
//! prover: the "honest-majority semi-honest ⇒ malicious-secure for free" folklore
//! holds for collaborative zk-SNARKs **only if the extended witness is validated
//! for cross-holder consistency BEFORE the proving phase opens or commits to any
//! value derived from it**. If a prover proves over an **inconsistent / maliciously
//! extended** witness, the protocol can **leak honest provers' private inputs**
//! through the proving transcript / induced openings — even when the verifier
//! still rejects the proof (re-audit Lens 1/3). The defence — requirement
//! **R-WV** — is a fail-closed validate-before-prove gate; a
//! "prove-anyway-and-let-the-verifier-reject" path is exactly the leak path and
//! MUST NOT exist.
//!
//! ## Current disposition — the obligation is OPEN (documented-gap), not MET
//!
//! There is **no built collaborative prover** to feed an invalid witness to:
//! every [`CollaborativeProof`] method returns [`MpcError::NotYetImplemented`]
//! naming its gate (`proof.rs`; the no-fake-crypto table, `adversarial_tests.rs`
//! ROW 2/3). So the validate-before-prove precondition cannot be MET today — there
//! is nothing to validate. The honest encoding is therefore two-tier:
//!
//! - **[`gate_state`] — a PASSING meta-test** that pins the *current* honest
//!   posture: the deferred `prove` refuses (fails closed with a gate-naming error)
//!   WITHOUT ever opening a witness-derived value or emitting a proof. Today this
//!   trivially satisfies "no prove-over-invalid-witness path exists" — *because no
//!   prover exists at all*. This is the regression anchor: if a future change makes
//!   `prove` start returning `Ok(..)` while this obligation is still unmet, the
//!   collaborative-proving soundness gate is being crossed and this test (plus the
//!   ignored suite below, once un-ignored) is what catches it.
//!
//! - **[`obligation`] — the `#[ignore]`d R-WV / T1–T4 suite** (re-audit §3).
//!   These are written against a `WitnessValidatingProver` interface the
//!   implementation MUST satisfy when the collaborative path is built
//!   (sq-f7bu / sq-bjl, milestone M-E). They are `#[ignore]`d **because there is
//!   no implementation to run them against** — running them now would require a
//!   real prover, which deliberately does not exist (building a fake one to make
//!   them pass would be exactly the fake crypto this crate forbids). Each carries
//!   a comment citing sq-9hrn / sq-qhy4 and stating it documents an OPEN soundness
//!   obligation. When the prover lands, these lift directly into its test suite
//!   and the `#[ignore]` is removed; until then `cargo test` reports them as
//!   ignored (green), and the gap is MEASURABLE rather than silent.
//!
//! NONE of this asserts the collaborative path is sound. Per the re-audit (§4)
//! and `lib.rs`/`README.md`, no production attestation/correctness claim may be
//! made over the collaborative path until R-WV is implemented, T1–T4 + clause C
//! pass un-ignored, the honest-majority malicious-security line (sq-km34.*) lands,
//! AND an external cryptographer audit covers the MULTI-prover construction
//! (`sq-qhy4` audits the single-prover verifier only and does NOT discharge this).
