// [OPUS-4.8] GlobalJoin trait + disclosed-key equi-join over GLOBAL IRIs (M2).
//! The cross-holder join protocol.
//!
//! Architecture refs: §2 convention #6 (GLOBAL IRIs as cross-credential join
//! keys — the distinguishing feature vs all prior graph-MPC), §4.3 step 4 (the
//! join model: key-on-key → (circuit-)PSI; non-key → oblivious join with
//! bounded intermediate size), §3.1 (PSI does NOT compose for free into a
//! multi-pattern BGP), and OPEN QUESTION **§5.2 Q3** (BGP-join obliviousness
//! cost).
//!
//! ## Why this is its own boundary
//!
//! GOOSE/SMPG/PPMQ all join on *node-local* (Cypher) identifiers, which
//! disqualifies them for federation: a node id is meaningful only inside one
//! database. The contribution here is joining on **global IRIs** that mean the
//! same thing across independent holders (architecture §2 convention #6). That
//! makes the join key a public, dereferenceable identifier — which interacts
//! directly with the no-proof-of-revealed-properties rule (#4): where the join
//! KEY is disclosed, the join can be checked OUTSIDE the cryptographic core (a
//! plaintext check over disclosed IRIs); only where joined VALUES must stay
//! hidden does the join go into the MPC. Q3 is exactly how much of the
//! per-pattern obliviousness padding that out-of-circuit handling collapses,
//! and for which SPARQL fragment (RQ2b).
//!
//! ## Status — M2: the disclosed-key path is REAL
//!
//! [`DisclosedKeyJoin`] implements [`GlobalJoin`] for the
//! `JoinPlan::key_disclosed == true` regime: a crypto-free equi-join over the
//! disclosed global-IRI key. Because a global IRI is a stable, public
//! cross-holder identifier, joining on it needs NO MPC primitive — it is a
//! plaintext check OUTSIDE the cryptographic core (convention #4), and is
//! *invariant to both design forks* (Q1/Q2). This is the PLAN's first M2 target.
//!
//! The **hidden-value** path (`key_disclosed == false`, where the join values
//! are PRIVATE and must enter a circuit-PSI / oblivious join) stays an honest
//! [`MpcError::NotYetImplemented`]: it is gated on a chosen
//! [`crate::backend::MpcBackend`] (M3) and on the Q2 trust-model fork + the Q3
//! BGP-join obliviousness-cost analysis (RQ2b). No fake crypto here.

/// - For each candidate row pair `(i, j)` the parties compute the secret-shared
///   difference `d = key_Li - key_Rj` (local), multiply by a fresh jointly-random
///   nonzero mask `r` (one Shamir multiplication), and **open only** `m = d·r`.
///   `m == 0 ⇔ keys equal`; for unequal keys `m` is a uniform-random nonzero
///   field element, so opening it reveals ONLY the match bit — never either key
///   value, never their difference. This is the standard MPC equality-to-zero
///   test ([`shamir::mul_shares_raw`] + [`shamir::reconstruct_degree`]).
/// - On a match, the DISCLOSED payload columns are emitted (they are disclosed
///   by the disclosure-minimisation rule, convention #4 — only the *key* is
///   hidden). The keys are NEVER reconstructed.
///
/// SCAFFOLDED / out of scope (honestly stated, not faked):
/// - The `O(|L|·|R|)` all-pairs comparison is the naive oblivious join. A real
///   circuit-PSI uses oblivious hashing / cuckoo bins to cut this to ~linear;
///   that optimisation (Q3, RQ2b — BGP-join obliviousness cost) is NOT done. The
///   all-pairs version is correct but not the SOTA cost profile.
/// - The field encoding of the key now has a documented, collision-resistant
///   construction — [`crate::term_encode::encode_term`] (domain-separated SHA-512
///   folded into the field) with a stated birthday bound, plus
///   [`crate::term_encode::KeyEncoder`] for a fail-closed exact-injectivity check
///   over a concrete key set (sq-dl81). Equality in `Fp` is then a SOUND stand-in
///   for term equality except on a birthday collision (`≈ q²/2^62`, negligible in
///   the ≤10⁴-row regime), which `KeyEncoder` detects. What is STILL deferred to
///   the collaborative proof (M4) is the in-circuit guarantee that the opened key
///   actually equals `encode_term` of the holder's real term — the encoding-
///   *correctness* proof, for which this encoder is the on-ramp.
/// - Malicious security (a party feeding inconsistent shares) is NOT provided —
///   semi-honest only, exactly as [`ShamirBackend`] states.
///
/// ## Feasibility envelope (honest, per the skill — minutes, not seconds)

/// Communication: ONE multiplication round PER candidate pair → `|L|·|R|` secure
