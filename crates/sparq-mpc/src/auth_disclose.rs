//! Honest-majority **tamper-evident-with-abort** threshold disclosure over an
//! EXISTING secret-shared sum — the IT-MAC upgrade of the semi-honest
//! [`crate::compare::disclose_threshold_verdict`] (Hole 4, the federation £100k path).
//!
//! **⚠ This module is EXPERIMENTAL and is NOT malicious-secure.** Its public entry
//! point is [`experimental_tamper_evident_disclose_threshold_verdict`] — renamed from
//! `malicious_disclose_threshold_verdict` in review round 2, because the old name
//! claimed a tier the code demonstrably misses (see "Integrity coverage is NOT total"
//! below, and that function's own docs for why a rename, rather than a revert, is the
//! containment that is actually available). The prose below describes the IT-MAC
//! construction as designed; read the residual section before treating any of it as a
//! guarantee against an actively-deviating party. `[SONNET-4.6]`
//!
//! ## What this closes (sq-ka8m residual)
//!
//! sq-ka8m's [`crate::auth_compare`] made the *cleartext fresh-operand* comparison
//! malicious-secure: it bit-shares the operands as authenticated values and
//! MAC-checks the verdict. But the FEDERATION path —
//! [`crate::compare::disclose_threshold_verdict`], which runs over an EXISTING
//! degree-`t` sharing `[sum]` (e.g. the cumulative aggregate from
//! [`crate::backend::MpcBackend::run_secure`]) — uses a *masked-open*
//! bit-decomposition (Damgård et al. TCC'06), not cleartext bit-sharing. That path
//! has **three distinct opens**, every one of them semi-honest (no integrity check)
//! on `origin/main`:
//!
//! 1. the **square-protocol `c = a²`** opened once per mask bit
//!    ([`crate::compare`] `square_protocol_random_bit`) — a forged open share /
//!    wrong re-sharing flips a mask bit;
//! 2. the **masked open `c = sum + r`** ([`crate::compare`] `secure_bit_decompose`)
//!    — the single load-bearing disclosure whose bits drive the whole comparison;
//! 3. the **boolean `verdict`** ([`crate::compare::open_verdict`]).
//!
//! Each is exactly the Hole-1/Hole-2 deviation the IT-MAC defends against: a
//! deviating party re-shares a consistent degree-`t` codeword of the *wrong* value,
//! undetectable by Reed–Solomon even at over-provisioned `n`. This module carries an
//! IT-MAC through all three and MAC-checks each opened value **before it is acted
//! on**, so a tamper aborts fail-closed at the minimal `n = 2t+1` (soundness from the
//! secret `α`, not RS redundancy — design §2.5).
//!
//! ## The construction
//!
//! - **Authenticate the existing sum.** `[[sum]] = ([sum], [α·sum])` via
//!   [`crate::shamir::MacSession::authenticate_existing`] — one BGW mult-then-reduce
//!   over `[α]` and `[sum]`, never reconstructing the sum.
//! - **Authenticated square-protocol mask bits.** Each mask bit `[[b]]` is produced
//!   from a fresh authenticated `[[a]]`: `[[a²]] = auth_mul([[a]],[[a]])`,
//!   **MAC-check `[[a²]]`**, open `c = a²`, then `[[b]] = (d⁻¹·[[a]] + 1)·2⁻¹` as
//!   FREE authenticated affine maps — so the bit stays MAC-carried into the
//!   subtraction circuit. `c = a²` is independent of the sign of `a`, so the open
//!   reveals nothing about the bit; the MAC-check catches a tampered open.
//! - **Authenticated masked open.** `[[r]] = Σ_k [[b_k]]·2^k` (free),
//!   `[[sum+r]] = auth_add([[sum]],[[r]])`, **MAC-check `[[sum+r]]`**, then open
//!   `c = sum + r`. The mask `r` is jointly generated (no party knows it), so `c`
//!   statistically hides `sum` exactly as the semi-honest path's open does.
//! - **Authenticated bitwise subtraction + comparison.** `[[a_k]] = c_k ⊖ [[r_k]]`
//!   over the PUBLIC bits of `c` and the AUTHENTICATED mask bits, with an
//!   authenticated ripple borrow (every AND an [`crate::shamir::MacSession::auth_mul`]);
//!   then the MSB-first comparator against the public threshold over `[[a_k]]`.
//! - **MAC-check the verdict, then open.** The verdict is the third and final open;
//!   the MAC-check over it (and the chain values it depends on) fires on any tamper
//!   in the subtraction or comparison gates.
//!
//! ## Security tier (stated precisely, no over-claim)
//!
//! **Honest-majority; tamper-EVIDENT-with-abort on the opened values, NOT full
//! malicious-with-abort** (design §3 aspires to the latter; see "Integrity coverage is
//! NOT total" below for the demonstrated gap). AXIS-2 `Abort(Unanimous)`, AXIS-3
//! `HonestMajority`; AXIS-1 is **not** `Malicious` today. The exact sum is NEVER opened
//! — only `c = a²` (sign-independent), the statistically-masked `c = sum + r`, and the
//! 1-bit verdict, and the latter two only after their MAC-checks pass — so the
//! CONFIDENTIALITY statement is unaffected by the integrity gap. `[SONNET-4.6]`
//!
//! ## The range-proof zero-tests are MAC-checked too (sq-m4zi / sq-e7ma)
//!
//! The in-protocol **range proof** (`sum ∈ [0, 2^`[`crate::compare::DECOMP_VALUE_BITS`]`)`,
//! sq-nx0s) — clause (1) recompose `sum == Σ b_k·2^k` and clause (2) high-part
//! `Σ_{k≥value_bits} b_k·2^k == 0`, each a secret zero-test of a `v·r` masked product
//! — was, on `sq-6fv7`, still reused VERBATIM from the SEMI-HONEST
//! `crate::compare::verify_sum_in_range`: a tampered open of either `v·r` product
//! (a wrong re-sharing producing a consistent codeword of the wrong value) could flip
//! "was it zero?" and let an out-of-range / field-wrapping sum masquerade as in-range,
//! defeating the fail-closed guard. `auth_verify_sum_in_range` closes that residual:
//! the range proof now runs over the AUTHENTICATED sum and bits, the recompose-diff and
//! high-part are FREE authenticated linear combinations, and each zero-test multiplies
//! by a fresh nonzero AUTHENTICATED mask via [`crate::shamir::MacSession::auth_mul`] and
//! **MAC-checks the product `[[v·r]]` before its open is read** — so a tampered zero-test
//! open aborts with [`MpcError::MacCheckFailed`] like the other three.
//!
//! ## [OPUS-4.8] sq-km34.6 — the production path is now the AUTHENTICATED RABBIT chain
//!
//! Everything above describes the *masked-open* construction, which capped this path's
//! sum at `2^`[`crate::compare::DECOMP_VALUE_BITS`]` = 2^20` — a 40-bit gap behind the
//! semi-honest [`crate::compare::disclose_threshold_verdict`], which sq-bgsn had already
//! lifted to the full `2^60`.
//! [`experimental_tamper_evident_disclose_threshold_verdict`] now routes through
//! `auth_bit_decompose_rabbit` instead: the Rabbit (eprint 2021/119) wrap
//! recovery, with **every** product and degree-reduce in its solved-bits / LTBits /
//! ripple-add / ripple-sub chain a [`crate::shamir::MacSession::auth_mul`], its single
//! masked open MAC-checked before `c` is read, its range proof
//! (`auth_verify_value_in_range_rabbit`) MAC-checked, and the boolean verdict
//! MAC-checked before it is opened. The two masked-open helpers are retained as
//! `#[cfg(test)]` regression references, exactly as `crate::compare` retains its own.
//!
//! The lift closes a real gap in the MAGNITUDE dimension: this path now supports the
//! SAME `2^60` as the semi-honest one. It does NOT lift the integrity tier — see
//! "Integrity coverage is NOT total" below before treating it as malicious-secure.
//! `[SONNET-4.6]`
//!
//! ## Residual (honest scope statement)
//!
//! - **Hiding.** The Rabbit open `c = (sum + r) mod p` is (near-)uniform with statistical
//!   distance `≤ 2^{-61}` from uniform — the field-size floor, INDEPENDENT of the sum's
//!   magnitude. (The masked-open path's `2^{-40}` gap, coupled to its 20-bit cap, applied
//!   to the now test-only helpers.) The exact sum is never opened.
//! - **Integrity coverage is NOT total — and the gap is LOAD-BEARING here (review round
//!   1).** `auth_mul` adopts a value tamper on its SECOND operand, and `mac_check` can
//!   only cover values that are opened anyway — so "a tamper in ANY gate aborts" is NOT
//!   claimed. This is not confined to an unrelated intermediate:
//!   `auth_secret_is_zero` places its supposedly-nonzero mask in exactly that adopted
//!   slot, so forcing the mask to a sharing of `0` makes a NONZERO `recompose_diff`
//!   yield an authenticated zero product and the range proof accepts a corrupted
//!   decomposition. The final verdict MAC-check cannot recover — it verifies a MAC that
//!   was adopted onto the wrong value upstream — so the pipeline returns a WRONG VERDICT
//!   rather than aborting. Pinned end to end by
//!   `a_zeroed_zero_test_mask_defeats_the_range_proof_and_flips_the_verdict`. **Until
//!   [`crate::shamir::MacSession`] gains multiplication-gate verification that binds BOTH
//!   operands (Chida-et-al. style), treat this path as a research/semi-honest surface:
//!   do NOT deploy it as the integrity tier against a genuinely malicious party.** See
//!   "What the MAC-check does NOT cover" on `auth_bit_decompose_rabbit`. `[SONNET-4.6]`
//! - **Containment applied (review round 2).** The entry point was renamed
//!   `malicious_disclose_threshold_verdict` →
//!   [`experimental_tamper_evident_disclose_threshold_verdict`], so the API no longer
//!   advertises the tier it misses; a doc caveat on a `malicious_*`-named drop-in is
//!   not containment. Two things this deliberately did NOT do, and why. **(a) It did not revert the sq-km34.6 Rabbit
//!   lift.** `auth_secret_is_zero` is byte-identical to `origin/main`, where the
//!   masked-open `auth_verify_sum_in_range` fed it the same adopted second-operand mask
//!   TWICE — the pre-lift production path was exploitable in exactly the same way, at a
//!   40-bit-narrower magnitude. Reverting would delete the witness, not the break.
//!   **(b) It did not "fix" the composition in this module.** Any in-module repair is
//!   local to one `auth_mul` call site while the adoption is a property of the
//!   primitive, present at every gate on the chain; the honest fix is the `MacSession`
//!   change named above, and a partial patch here would read as closure. `[SONNET-4.6]`
//! - The dishonest-majority SPDZ regime (route (b) / sq-j5ok) is NOT entered. `[OPUS-4.8]`

///
/// ## Protocol (and where the MAC sits at each step)
///
/// 1. Deal a fresh full-field solved-bits mask `([[r]], [[r]]_B)`,
///    `r ∈ [0, 2^`[`RABBIT_MASK_BITS`]`)` uniform, no party knows it
///    ([`auth_deal_full_field_solved_bits`]). Every mask bit comes from the
///    AUTHENTICATED square protocol, whose `a²` open is MAC-checked before it is read.
/// 2. **Open `c = (x + r) mod p`** — the ONLY opening in the decomposition, and it is
///    **MAC-checked before `c` is read** ([`MacSession::mac_check`], §2.5). `x` itself
///    is never opened; `c` is (near-)uniform over `[0, p)` (see "Hiding").
/// 3. **Exact wrap recovery.** Over the integers `x = c − r + w·p` with
///    `w = 1{c < r}` = [`auth_rabbit_lt_bits_public_less_than_shared`]`(c, [[r]]_B)`
///    (proof: in the wrap case `c = x + r − p` and `c < r ⇔ x < p`, always true; in
///    the no-wrap case `c = x + r ≥ r`). Then `[[t]]_B = c_B + w·p`
///    ([`auth_rabbit_add_public_and_w_times_const`]) and
///    `[[x]]_B = [[t]]_B ⊖ [[r]]_B` ([`auth_rabbit_sub_shared_bits`]). The arithmetic
///    is exact (`x < p < 2^61`, `c + w·p < 2p < 2^62`), so a `W = L + 1` working width
///    overflows nothing; the returned [`RABBIT_VALUE_BITS`] low bits are `x`'s bits.
///
/// ## MAC coverage of the chain (the sq-km34.6 obligation — stated precisely)
///
/// Steps 1 and 3 are a DEEP arithmetic circuit — every gate a place a malicious party
/// can inject an undetected offset by forging a product share (Hole 1) or re-sharing a
/// consistent degree-`t` codeword of the WRONG value inside `degree_reduce` (Hole 2),
/// neither detectable by Reed–Solomon at the minimal `n = 2t+1`. **Every** product in
/// the LTBits recurrence, the carry chain, the borrow chain and the XORs routes through
/// [`MacSession::auth_mul`], whose §2.4 independent-reduce carry keeps the output MAC
/// equal to `α·(true product)` when the VALUE reduce is tampered; the linear ops
/// (`1 − b`, `+`, public scaling) carry the MAC for FREE, so there is no
/// *unauthenticated* seam between the gates.
///
/// What that buys, concretely, is what the tests check: the single open is MAC-checked
/// before `c` is read; and a tamper on the wrap indicator `[[w]]`, or on ANY recovered
/// bit `[[b_k]]`, ABORTS the pipeline fail-closed — the latter because the caller's
/// range proof folds every `[[b_k]]` linearly into a value it then feeds to `auth_mul`
/// in the FIRST operand slot (see [`auth_verify_value_in_range_rabbit`]). That
/// abort-on-a-tampered-bit property rests ENTIRELY on the range proof, which the next
/// section shows a malicious party can switch off — so read the two together.
///
/// ## What the MAC-check does NOT cover (honest residual — this is NOT "any tamper aborts")
///
/// [`MacSession::auth_mul`] carries the MAC as `[α·z] = reduce([α·x]·[y])` — the FIRST
/// operand's MAC times the SECOND operand's VALUE. So a value tamper on the **second**
/// operand is *adopted*: the gate recomputes a MAC consistent with the tampered value,
/// and the batched check on that product passes although the product is WRONG. This is
/// a property of the sq-km34.3/.4 primitives (it applies equally to
/// [`crate::auth_compare`] and to the masked-open path in this module), and it cannot
/// be closed by checking more values here: [`MacSession::mac_check`] **opens** every
/// value it checks, so it can only ever cover values that are public anyway — never
/// secret intermediates. Closing it needs the Chida-et-al. verification of ALL
/// multiplication gate outputs, with `α` revealed only after the circuit is fixed so
/// that the check is linear and opens nothing — a change to `MacSession`, not to this
/// module. The residual is pinned by the witness test
/// `mac_check_adopts_a_second_operand_tamper_but_catches_a_first_operand_one`, which
/// goes red if the primitive is ever fixed. The design record's §2.5 "closes all four
/// holes" phrasing is therefore **stronger than what the code delivers today**.
///
/// **This is EXPLOITABLE on this path, not merely theoretical** [SONNET-4.6]:
/// [`auth_verify_value_in_range_rabbit`]'s zero-test hands its mask to `auth_mul` in
/// precisely the adopted second slot, so a zeroed mask neutralises the range proof — the
/// one check that catches a corrupted `[[b_k]]` — and the pipeline then returns the
/// adversary's verdict instead of aborting
/// (`a_zeroed_zero_test_mask_defeats_the_range_proof_and_flips_the_verdict`). The
/// "What that buys, concretely" paragraph above therefore holds ONLY against an
/// adversary that leaves the zero-test mask alone.
///
/// ## Hiding (stated honestly — `2^{-61}`, not perfect)
///
/// `r` is a sum of `L = 61` exactly-uniform bits, so it is uniform over `[0, 2^61)`,
/// ONE element wider than `p = 2^61 − 1`. After `mod p` the value `0` is hit by both
/// `r = 0` and `r = p`, giving `c`'s distribution statistical distance `≤ 1/p ≈ 2^{-61}`
/// from uniform — a cryptographic-strength gap, INDEPENDENT of the value's magnitude
/// (unlike the masked-open path's `2^{-40}` that was coupled to the 20-bit cap).
///
