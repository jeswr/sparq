// [OPUS-4.8] sq-py8h.4 — hidden-key endpoint DISTINCT (the gated sub-piece of the
// bounded property-path operator): collapse duplicate *secret* endpoint pairs.
//! Hidden-key endpoint **DISTINCT**: collapse duplicate *secret* endpoint pairs
//! `(?a, ?b)` — where BOTH endpoints are private secret-shared join keys — into a
//! set, **without ever opening a key** (design
//! `research/mpc-bounded-property-path-design.md` §2.5, §3 "the one genuinely gated
//! sub-piece", §6 step 4).
//!
//! ## What this is — and how it differs from the OR-fold dedup of sq-py8h.3
//!
//! The bounded property-path operator returns a *set* of endpoint pairs. Two
//! distinct dedup obligations arise, and they are NOT the same problem:
//!
//! 1. **Cross-length / cross-branch multiplicity** — one endpoint pair reached by a
//!    2-hop AND a 4-hop chain (or by two alternation branches). [`crate::hidden_path`]
//!    already collapses this by **OR-folding** the per-chain connected-bits per
//!    *disclosed* endpoint key (`endpoint_key` over the disclosed `Term`s). That is
//!    sound and shippable today and is the headline federation case (the endpoints
//!    are the disclosed result).
//!
//! 2. **Duplicate *secret* endpoint pairs** — the SAME pair arriving on several
//!    input rows where the endpoints are themselves PRIVATE keys (`?a`, `?b` are not
//!    disclosed global IRIs but secret-shared `F_p` values). Grouping by a disclosed
//!    term is impossible here — there is no disclosed key to group on — so collapsing
//!    the duplicates requires deciding key-equality **in MPC**. This module is that
//!    gated piece (it was blocked on the secure comparator `sq-rrz4` → degree
//!    reduction `sq-dvuc`, both now landed).
//!
//! ## The construction (design §2.5 / §3, realised against landed primitives)
//!
//! Given `N` candidate rows, each carrying a secret-shared composite key
//! `(a_key, b_key)` (both `< 2^`[`crate::compare::COMPARE_BITS`]) and the
//! disclosed-on-output endpoint terms `(a_term, b_term)`:
//!
//! 1. **Oblivious sort by the secret composite key.** Run the data-independent
//!    [`crate::oblivious::SortingNetwork`] (Batcher odd-even mergesort — its
//!    compare-exchange access pattern is a function of `N` only, the obliviousness
//!    substrate). At each compare-exchange `(i, j)` we decide the swap with a
//!    **secret-shared** comparator: `swap = lex_greater((a_i,b_i), (a_j,b_j))` built
//!    from [`crate::compare::secure_greater_than`] +
//!    [`crate::compare::secure_equal_to_bit`] (lexicographic on `a` then `b`) — a
//!    fresh degree-`t` 0/1 sharing that is **NEVER opened**. The two rows' key limbs
//!    are then swapped by the arithmetic **conditional swap** `x' = x + swap·(y − x)`,
//!    so the *order* of the comparison verdicts is never revealed. The disclosed
//!    payload terms ride co-indexed through the same swap (the simulation holds them
//!    in the clear exactly as [`crate::oblivious_join::oblivious_set_output`] does;
//!    the permutation is hidden because every swap bit is secret and the FINAL output
//!    re-shuffles before any reveal — so the sorted intermediate order is never
//!    opened).
//!
//! 2. **Adjacent-equality scan → secret keep-bit.** After the sort, equal-key rows
//!    are contiguous. For each row `r > 0` we compute `dup_r = [key_r == key_{r−1}]`
//!    (one [`crate::compare::secure_equal_to_bit`] per key limb, ANDed) — a
//!    secret-shared bit, never opened — and set `keep_r = 1 − dup_r` (the first
//!    occurrence of each distinct key has `keep = 1`; every later duplicate has
//!    `keep = 0`). Row 0 always keeps. This is the classic *adjacent-equality* dedup
//!    a sorted run admits, lifted into MPC.
//!
//! 3. **Oblivious compaction.** Each sorted row becomes a
//!    [`crate::oblivious_join::Candidate`] whose disclosed payload is `(a_term,
//!    b_term)` and whose [`crate::oblivious_join::MatchBit::SecretShared`] selector
//!    is `keep_r`. Feeding them to [`crate::oblivious_join::oblivious_set_output`]
//!    with a public padded bound `B` performs the oblivious select (`tag = keep ·
//!    real_tag`, one product, no open), re-shuffles the slots, and reveals exactly
//!    `B` shuffled slots: a duplicate row (`keep = 0`) opens to a dummy and is
//!    filtered, so each distinct secret pair survives **once**.
//!
//! ## What stays hidden / what is disclosed (state it precisely)
//!
//! - **Hidden:** every endpoint join KEY (`a_key`, `b_key` — never reconstructed);
//!   every per-comparison swap bit and every adjacent-equality `dup` bit
//!   (secret-shared, never opened); WHICH rows were duplicates of which (the
//!   multiplicity structure); the input→output position linkage (the final shuffle
//!   destroys it); the true distinct count beyond the public `B` (L1 bounded to `B`).
//! - **Disclosed:** the row count `N` and the public padded bound `B` (the sort
//!   network width and the output slot count are public, the standard MPC
//!   assumption); the endpoint TERMS of the surviving distinct pairs (the result the
//!   recipient asked for).
//!
//! ## Security tier (HONESTY — privacy-claims gate, cite sq-qhy4)
//!
//! Honest-majority, semi-honest ONLY — inherits the [`crate::shamir::ShamirBackend`]
//! / [`crate::compare`] / [`crate::oblivious_join`] model and adds **no new
//! assumption**. Every comparison, equality and conditional swap routes through
//! [`crate::shamir::ShamirDealer::degree_reduce`], whose reshare has no in-protocol
//! check that a deviating party reshared honestly, so this is **NOT** maliciously
//! secure (the same degree-`2t`-at-`n=2t+1` residual the rest of the backend
//! documents; sq-6d6g / sq-km34 IT-MAC is the named fix). The confidentiality this
//! closes (collapsing secret duplicates without opening keys) is a CONFIDENTIALITY
//! axis, orthogonal to malicious security; external soundness sign-off is still
//! pending (sq-qhy4). No guarantee beyond the documented semi-honest model is
//! claimed.
//!
//! ## Cost (MODELLED — counted, not measured)
//!
//! The sort is `O(N log² N)` compare-exchanges, each a lexicographic secure compare
//! (a bit-decomposition + AND-tree, the cost [`crate::compare::secure_greater_than`]
//! pays) plus a constant-limb conditional swap; the adjacent scan is `N − 1` secure
//! equalities; the compaction is the `B`-slot [`crate::oblivious_join`] cost. The
//! returned [`DistinctCost`] reports these counts (no hard-coded wall-clock).
