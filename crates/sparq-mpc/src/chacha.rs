// [OPUS-4.8] sq-it50: a minimal ChaCha20 CSPRNG that sparq fully OWNS, so its
// key schedule can be scrubbed on drop.
//! Owned ChaCha20 keystream generator with a scrubbable key schedule.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (sq-it50, follow-up to sq-19ej)
//!
//! [`crate::rng::SecureRng`] needs a ChaCha20 CSPRNG whose **entire secret state
//! is zeroized on drop**. The ecosystem `rand_chacha::ChaCha20Rng` cannot do this
//! from our side: it exposes no `zeroize` feature, no `Drop`/`Zeroize` impl, and
//! no `&mut` accessor to its private, expanded key words (the key schedule,
//! recoverable via `get_seed()`). So the residual secret — the expanded ChaCha key
//! — lingered on the stack after drop. That was the documented, NOT-scrubbed
//! residual on `SecureRng` (sq-19ej).
//!
//! This module closes that residual by owning a tiny, self-contained ChaCha20
//! keystream generator. Because *we* hold the 16-word block state, we can
//! `#[derive(ZeroizeOnDrop)]` on it: every secret word (the key, the block
//! counter, and the cached keystream block) is overwritten with zeros when the
//! generator is dropped. There is no longer any sparq-reachable copy of the key
//! material that survives drop.
//!
//! ## What this is (and is NOT)
//!
//! - It IS the standard ChaCha20 block function (RFC 8439 §2.3): a 256-bit key, a
//!   64-bit block counter, and a 64-bit nonce arranged as the canonical 4×4 state
//!   of 32-bit words `["expa","nd 3","2-by","te k", key×8, counter_lo, counter_hi,
//!   nonce_lo, nonce_hi]`, run through 20 rounds (10 column + 10 diagonal
//!   double-rounds). Correctness is pinned to the RFC 8439 §2.3.2 and §2.4.2
//!   known-answer vectors in the tests.
//! - The nonce is fixed at **zero**: this is a *deterministic CSPRNG keyed by a
//!   fresh OS seed*, not a stream cipher reused across messages. Each
//!   [`crate::rng::SecureRng`] mints a brand-new generator from fresh OS entropy
//!   and never re-keys, so a fixed nonce is correct (the (key, nonce) pair is used
//!   exactly once, for one ever-incrementing counter sequence). It is NOT to be
//!   used to encrypt with a caller-chosen or reused key.
//! - The 64-bit block counter is monotone and wide enough that a single session
//!   cannot exhaust it (2^64 blocks = 2^70 bytes); we still guard the wrap in
//!   debug to surface misuse.
//!
//! ## Security note
//!
//! ChaCha20 is a vetted CSPRNG construction; the security of the masks/shares
//! rests on the OS seed being unpredictable (`getrandom`) and the key schedule not
//! leaking — which is exactly what the scrub-on-drop here protects. The quarter
//! round and block function are constant-time (no secret-dependent branch or
//! index); throughput is not a concern for the masking path (a handful of field
//! elements per dealing session).
