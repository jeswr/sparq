// [OPUS-4.8] sq-py8h.2 — HIDDEN-intermediate fixed exactly-`k` property-path chain
// (the cryptographic core of the bounded property-path operator).
//! Bounded property-path over a **secret graph**: the HIDDEN-intermediate fixed
//! exactly-`k` chain (`?a (p){k} ?b`) where the intermediate nodes `?z_1 … ?z_{k−1}`
//! are **never opened**.
//!
//! ## What this is (and how it differs from the disclosed-key sibling)
//!
//! This resolves **increment #2** of the bounded property-path design
//! (`research/mpc-bounded-property-path-design.md` §2.1 HIDDEN regime, §2.6, §6
//! step 2) — the **cryptographic core** the disclosed-key module
//! ([`crate::bounded_path`]) explicitly deferred. There the join keys are disclosed
//! global IRIs and the whole chain is a crypto-free fold of equi-joins. HERE the
//! intermediate node *values* are PRIVATE (secret-shared `F_p` keys): a chain
//! `a → z_1 → … → z_{k−1} → b` exists iff there is a sequence of `k` edges whose
//! join points line up, and each "lines up" test is decided as a **secret-shared
//! match bit that is never opened** — so no intermediate node `z_i`, and no per-hop
//! / per-pair match pattern, is ever reconstructed.
//!
//! ## The construction (design §2.1 / §2.6, realised against landed primitives)
//!
//! The federated edge set `E` is the union of every holder's `(subject, object)`
//! edges for the path predicate, each endpoint carried as `(private F_p key,
//! disclosed endpoint term)`. (The endpoint *terms* are the disclosed RESULT of the
//! path — convention #4: only the *intermediate join values* are hidden. The
//! candidate edge-tuple COUNT `|E|^k` is public, the standard MPC assumption.)
//!
//! An exactly-`k` chain is a `k`-tuple of edges `(e_1, …, e_k)` that is "connected":
//!
//! ```text
//! connected(e_1,…,e_k) = AND_{i=1..k-1}  [ e_i.object_key == e_{i+1}.subject_key ]
//! ```
//!
//! Each internal equality is computed with [`crate::compare::secure_equal_to_bit`]
//! — a bit-decomposition equality whose 0/1 verdict is a fresh degree-`t`
//! **secret-shared** sharing that is NEVER opened (so the L2 per-pair / per-hop
//! match-graph leak is closed *at the decision*, not merely at the output). The
//! `k − 1` internal-hop bits are AND-ed into a single per-tuple **chain bit** by
//! one [`crate::shamir::mul_shares_raw`] + one
//! [`crate::shamir::ShamirDealer::degree_reduce`] per AND — the BGW reshare-and-
//! recombine round (sq-dvuc, the keystone this bead depends on) that lets a
//! degree-`2t` product be reshared back to degree `t` so the next AND can chain.
//! For `k = 1` every edge is a trivially-connected length-1 chain, so the chain bit
//! is the constant shared `1` (no internal hop).
//!
//! Each tuple is a candidate whose endpoint pair `(a, b) = (e_1.subject,
//! e_k.object)` is the disclosed payload. **Set semantics (design §2.2/§2.5):** a
//! pair reachable by several distinct edge-tuples must appear ONCE, with the
//! realized chain *never* revealed. We therefore GROUP tuples by their disclosed
//! endpoint pair and **OR-fold** their chain bits into one connected-bit per
//! distinct `(a, b)` (`OR(x,y) = 1 − (1−x)(1−y)`, one more `mul_shares_raw` +
//! `degree_reduce`). Grouping is over the DISCLOSED endpoint terms — never over any
//! secret intermediate key — so it leaks nothing the result does not already
//! disclose.
//!
//! The one connected-bit per distinct endpoint pair becomes a
//! [`crate::oblivious_join::Candidate`] with a
//! [`crate::oblivious_join::MatchBit::SecretShared`] selector, fed verbatim into the
//! landed oblivious output path
//! ([`crate::oblivious_join::oblivious_set_output`], sq-jnkm): the secret bit drives
//! an oblivious select (one product, no open), the slots are shuffled, and exactly a
//! public padded bound `B` of slots is revealed. The per-pair match bit is never
//! opened anywhere; only the `B` shuffled output tags are opened (classifying a slot
//! as a real endpoint row or a dummy AFTER the permutation destroyed
//! position→candidate linkage).
//!
//! ## What stays hidden / what is disclosed (state it precisely)
//!
//! - **Hidden:** every intermediate node key `z_i` (never reconstructed); every
//!   per-hop and per-pair match bit (secret-shared, never opened); the realized
//!   chain that connected a pair (the OR-fold collapses multiplicity); the true
//!   result cardinality beyond the public `B` (L1 bounded to `B`).
//! - **Disclosed:** the public bound `k`; the public candidate-tuple count `|E|^k`
//!   (standard MPC assumption); the endpoint TERMS of the matched pairs (the result
//!   the recipient asked for); the public padded bound `B`.
//!
//! ## Security tier (HONESTY — privacy-claims gate, cite sq-qhy4)
//!
//! Honest-majority, semi-honest ONLY — inherits the [`crate::shamir::ShamirBackend`]
//! / [`crate::compare`] model and adds no new assumption. Every multiplication
//! routes through [`crate::shamir::ShamirDealer::degree_reduce`], whose reshare has
//! no in-protocol check that a deviating party reshared honestly, so this is **NOT**
//! maliciously secure (the same degree-`2t`-at-`n=2t+1` residual the rest of the
//! backend documents; sq-6d6g / sq-km34 IT-MAC is the named fix). The
//! per-intermediate / per-pair confidentiality this closes is a CONFIDENTIALITY
//! axis, orthogonal to malicious security; external soundness sign-off is still
//! pending (sq-qhy4). No guarantee beyond the documented semi-honest model is
//! claimed.
//!
//! ## Scope boundary (do not over-read)
//!
//! This is the **exactly-`k`** chain ONLY (`?a (p){k} ?b`, `k >= 1`). The bounded
//! `{1,k}` / `{0,k}` / `p?` union + reflexive diagonal + alternation, with the
//! cross-length OR-fold dedup, is the sibling increment **sq-py8h.3** (it builds the
//! union of exactly-`ℓ` chains ON TOP of this). DISTINCT over genuinely-secret
//! endpoint pairs (collapsing duplicate *secret* `(a,b)`) is the gated piece
//! **sq-py8h.4** (needs the secure-sort comparator). Planner guards / cost wiring is
//! **sq-py8h.5**. Here the endpoint dedup is over the DISCLOSED endpoint terms,
//! which is exactly the headline case (the endpoints are the disclosed result).
