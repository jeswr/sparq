// [OPUS-4.8] Per-holder local SPARQL sub-evaluation — the REAL M0 core.
//! Per-holder local SPARQL sub-evaluation.
//!
//! Architecture refs: §4.1 (holders own one-or-more signed named graphs),
//! §4.3 step 1 (holders ingest their VCs and evaluate locally), and the
//! load-bearing §4.2 invariant: **minimise inter-node data sharing**. A holder
//! evaluates a query fragment over ITS OWN graphs *locally* and ships only the
//! disclosed partial result — it never hands its raw graphs to anyone.
//!
//! This is the one piece that is genuinely implemented at Milestone 0, because
//! it is **invariant to both open design forks** (§5.2): no matter which MPC
//! primitive (Q2) or which collaborative-proof construction (Q1) is chosen
//! later, the federation always begins by each holder answering what it can
//! over its own data. Everything cryptographic is layered ON TOP of these
//! partials by [`crate::backend`], [`crate::join`] and [`crate::proof`].
//!
//! What this is NOT: it is not the MPC. Joining partials across holders on
//! global IRIs, hiding intermediate values, and proving correctness/attestation
//! are all deferred. A [`Holder`] here is a plaintext local evaluator — the
//! honest substrate the privacy layer wraps.
