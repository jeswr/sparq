// [OPUS-4.8] sq-1vt: cryptographically-secure masking RNG for the Shamir backend.
//! Randomness for secret-sharing / masking — the security-critical RNG seam.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (sq-1vt, a real confidentiality weakness)
//!
//! Shamir secret sharing hides a secret behind a degree-`t` polynomial whose
//! *free coefficients are random*, and the circuit-PSI equality test hides the
//! key difference behind a *random nonzero mask*. The whole information-theoretic
//! hiding argument (any `<= t` shares are independent of the secret; the opened
//! product `m = d·r` leaks nothing about `d` beyond `d == 0`) assumes those
//! coefficients / masks are **unpredictable**. If they come from a deterministic,
//! seedable, non-cryptographic PRNG (e.g. SplitMix64), an adversary who learns or
//! guesses the seed/state can reconstruct every mask and every share — collapsing
//! confidentiality. **Masking randomness MUST come from a CSPRNG.**
//!
//! ## The seam: [`MpcRng`]
//!
//! The backend draws masking field elements through the [`MpcRng`] trait, not a
//! concrete RNG. There are exactly two implementors and they are NOT
//! interchangeable by accident:
//!
//! - [`SecureRng`] — the **production / default** masking RNG. An **owned**
//!   ChaCha20 CSPRNG (`crate::chacha::ChaCha20Csprng`, private to this crate)
//!   seeded from OS entropy (`getrandom::fill`). This is what the real
//!   protocol uses and the only RNG reachable from the default
//!   [`crate::shamir::ShamirBackend::new`] constructor. We own the cipher (rather
//!   than wrapping `rand_chacha::ChaCha20Rng`) specifically so its key schedule is
//!   zeroized on drop — see the secret-memory-hygiene note on [`SecureRng`]
//!   (sq-it50).
//! - `InsecureTestRng` (`#[cfg(any(test, feature = "insecure-test-rng"))]`,
//!   so not an intra-doc link in default builds) — a **deterministic, seedable
//!   SplitMix64** PRNG for
//!   reproducible tests/benchmarks ONLY. It is gated behind
//!   `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "insecure-test-rng"))]` so it cannot be
//!   constructed from a normal (non-test, default-feature) build. Its name
//!   carries the warning; there is no way to wire it into the real masking path
//!   without opting into the `insecure-test-rng` feature.
//!
//! ## Uniform field sampling (no modulo bias)
//!
//! Field elements must be **uniform over `F_p`** for the hiding argument to hold;
//! a skewed distribution leaks information about the secret. `Fp::new(raw_u64)`
//! reduces by `% P`, which is *biased* when `raw_u64` ranges over all of
//! `[0, 2^64)` (the residues `[0, 2^64 mod P)` are over-represented). With
//! `p = 2^61 - 1` we instead **rejection-sample**: take the low 61 bits of a
//! fresh `u64` (a value in `[0, 2^61)`) and reject the single value `2^61 - 1`
//! (`== P`, which is not a canonical residue), re-drawing on rejection. Rejection
//! probability is `1/2^61`, so this is effectively constant-time in expectation
//! and the result is *exactly* uniform over `{0, 1, …, P-1}`. See [`next_fp`].
//!

/// [OPUS-4.8] The CSPRNG seed/key/keystream state is secret (it predicts every
/// mask and Shamir coefficient). `SecureRng` redacts its [`Debug`], forbids
/// [`Clone`], and zeroizes on drop **the entire secret state, including the key

///
/// - **The sparq-held seed buffer (scrubbed).** [`from_os`](SecureRng::from_os)
///   pulls the 32-byte ChaCha seed into a [`zeroize::Zeroizing`] buffer that this
///   crate owns, feeds a *copy* to the owned ChaCha constructor, and the buffer is
///   wiped when the constructor returns — so the only sparq-controlled secret byte
///   buffer never lingers.
/// - **The key schedule (scrubbed — sq-it50).** The inner CSPRNG is now an
///   **owned** `crate::chacha::ChaCha20Csprng` (NOT `rand_chacha`), whose full
///   16-word block state (the expanded ChaCha key, the block counter, and the
///   cached 64-byte keystream block) is `#[derive(ZeroizeOnDrop)]`. Dropping
///   `SecureRng` drops the inner cipher, which overwrites every secret word with
///   zeros. There is no longer any sparq-reachable copy of the key material that
///   survives drop, and no `get_seed()`-style accessor that re-exposes it.
///
/// ## Why we own the cipher (sq-it50)
/// Ecosystem `rand_chacha::ChaCha20Rng` could not be scrubbed in place from this
/// crate — verified at the latest published `0.10.0` (Feb 2026) as well as the
/// pinned `0.9`, it exposes **no `zeroize` feature**, implements no `Drop`/`Zeroize`,
/// and gives no `&mut` accessor to the private key words; its key schedule
/// (recoverable via `get_seed()`) lingered on the stack after drop. Rather than
/// fake a scrub we could not perform, sq-19ej documented that as an irreducible
/// residual and beaded the fix; sq-it50 closes it by replacing the dependency with
/// a minimal, fully-owned ChaCha20 keystream generator we *can* zeroize. The
/// generator is correctness-pinned to the RFC 8439 known-answer vectors (see
/// `crate::chacha`); RNG *behaviour* is unchanged for the protocol (a CSPRNG
