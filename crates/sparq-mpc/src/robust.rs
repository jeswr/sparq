// [OPUS-4.8] sq-m34i (MPC WI-1): Reed-Solomon consistency-checked + robust
// (Berlekamp-Welch) reconstruction over Fp. Closes malicious-security gap (D)
// at the Shamir layer for the honest-majority abort/robust regime. Written while
// Fable unavailable — re-review on return.
//! Reed–Solomon error-detection / error-correction for Shamir reconstruction.
//!
//! ## The codeword view (why this works with NO new dependency)
//!
//! A Shamir sharing of a degree-`t` secret polynomial `Q` evaluated at `n`
//! distinct nonzero points `x_1..x_n` is **exactly** an `[n, t+1]` Reed–Solomon
//! codeword over the existing field `F_p` ([`crate::field`]). The message is the
//! `t+1` low coefficients of `Q` (the secret is `Q(0)`); the codeword is the `n`
//! evaluations `y_i = Q(x_i)`. Plain Lagrange interpolation
//! (`shamir::reconstruct_at_zero`, now `#[cfg(test)]` — no production caller after
//! WI-2, so not an intra-doc link) is RS *decoding under the assumption
//! that every symbol is correct* — it has no consistency check, so one tampered
//! `y_i` silently yields the wrong `Q(0)` even when redundancy is present
//! (pinned by `adversarial_tests::tamper`; bead sq-uu0u).
//!
//! With redundancy (`n > t+1`) the same codeword view gives us, for FREE over the
//! same `F_p` (no Feldman/Pedersen DLOG group, no SPDZ MAC preprocessing, no
//! bigint — see sq-uu0u "REJECTED for now"):
//!
//! - **Detect** any tampering, for any number of errors, by checking all `n`
//!   points lie on a single degree-`t` polynomial.
//! - **Correct** up to `e = ⌊(n − t − 1)/2⌋` tampered shares (the RS / BW bound
//!   `n ≥ t + 2e + 1`) and return the TRUE secret — *robust* reconstruction.
//!
//! ## Threat model (honest-majority, information-theoretic)
//!
//! This adds detect-and-abort (and, where the bound allows, robust correction)
//! against ACTIVE tampering of share *values* — guarantee (D) at the Shamir
//! layer. It needs no PKI, broadcast, or preprocessing. It does NOT defend:
//!
//! - **Exactly `t+1` shares (no redundancy).** Any `t+1` arbitrary points define
//!   *some* degree-`t` polynomial, so a single forged share just selects a
//!   different (wrong) secret with no inconsistency to detect. No scheme can
//!   detect this; we preserve the existing behaviour and say so explicitly
//!   ([`reconstruct_robust`] returns the interpolation, never a false
//!   `Tampered`). This is pinned by a test.
//! - **More than the correctable budget with sub-detectable structure.** When
//!   `#errors > e` the BW system can fail to yield a consistent codeword; we
//!   ABORT ([`MpcError::Tampered`]) rather than guess. (RS *miscorrection* — a
//!   second valid codeword within distance `e` — needs `> e` coordinated errors
//!   and is the standard RS limitation, not a regression over plain Lagrange,
//!   which silently miscorrects on a SINGLE error.)
//!
//!   **Residual miscorrection window (the adversarial caveat, sq-6u6b (3)).** The
//!   one case where robust reconstruction returns a WRONG secret WITHOUT aborting
//!   is when `> e` tampered shares happen to land the corrupted vector within
//!   Hamming distance `e` of a *different* valid degree-`degree` codeword `Q'`.
//!   BW then "corrects" to `Q' ≠ Q` and the all-points re-check passes (the
//!   tampered points now look like the `≤ e` errors of `Q'`), so we return
//!   `Q'(0)` and name the honest minority as the corrected shares. This requires
//!   the adversary to (a) control more than `e` shares AND (b) choose their
//!   deltas so the result is near a second codeword — which over a random-looking
//!   field `F_p = 2^61 − 1` means hitting a `(degree+1)`-coordinate algebraic
//!   coincidence with the remaining honest shares. For independent/random deltas
//!   the probability is `≈ |codewords within distance e| / p^{redundancy}`, i.e.
//!   astronomically small (`~2^{-61}` per honest constraint). It is nonetheless a
//!   REAL malicious caveat, not a numerical artefact: it is the generic RS
//!   bounded-distance-decoding limit, and the information-theoretic MAC layer
//!   (WI-4, bead sq-6d6g) — whose soundness comes from the secret `α`, not from
//!   codeword distance — is what closes it. Detection of `≤ e` errors is, by
//!   contrast, unconditional.
//! - **The degree-`2t` equality/mult open at `n = 2t+1`** (`join::secure_equal`).
//!   WI-2 (bead sq-7q9i) routes that open through THIS primitive at degree `2t`
//!   ([`crate::shamir::reconstruct_degree`]): it detects/corrects when
//!   `n > 2t+1`, but at exactly `n = 2t+1` degree `2t` has NO RS redundancy, so
//!   the same no-redundancy non-detection above applies — a forged product share
//!   is undetectable there. A true fix at `n = 2t+1` needs an information-
//!   theoretic MAC (deferred WI-4, bead sq-6d6g), not RS redundancy.
//!
//! ## Algorithm — Berlekamp–Welch via Gaussian elimination over `F_p`
//!
//! For target error budget `e`, find an **error-locator** `E(x)` of degree `e`
//! (monic: leading coeff 1) and `N(x)` of degree `t + e` such that
//! `N(x_i) = y_i · E(x_i)` for every share `i`, where (by construction)
//! `N(x) = E(x)·Q(x)`. Writing the unknown coefficients of `E` (the `e` below the
//! monic top) and of `N` (`t+e+1` of them) gives a linear system in `t + 2e + 1`
//! unknowns over `n ≥ t + 2e + 1` equations:
//!
//! ```text
//!   N(x_i) − y_i·E(x_i) = 0
//!   ⟺  Σ_{k≤t+e} N_k x_i^k  −  y_i·(Σ_{k<e} E_k x_i^k + x_i^e) = 0
//!   ⟺  Σ_{k≤t+e} N_k x_i^k  −  Σ_{k<e} (y_i x_i^k) E_k  =  y_i x_i^e
//! ```
//!
//! We solve it by Gaussian elimination over `F_p` (uses [`Fp::inv`]/`mul`),
//! recover `Q = N / E` by exact polynomial division (the remainder MUST be zero
//! — if it is not, the candidate is rejected), and return `Q(0)`. Finally we
//! re-verify that *all* `n` original points satisfy the recovered `Q`; only then
//! is the result trusted. `O(n^3)` Gaussian elimination is fine at the intended
//! party counts (`n` = 3..9).
