// [OPUS-4.8] sq-dl81 — the collision-resistant Term->Fp join-key encoder + the
// injectivity contract the hidden-value join rests on.
//! Domain-separated `Term -> Fp` encoding for PRIVATE join keys.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (the soundness gap it closes)
//!
//! [`crate::join::HiddenValueJoin`] (and the hidden property-path chain,
//! [`crate::hidden_path`]) joins two holders on a key WITHOUT revealing it, by a
//! secret-shared **field-equality** test over [`Fp`]: it opens only the masked
//! product `m = (key_L − key_R)·r`, and `m == 0 ⇔ key_L == key_R` *in the field*.
//! That field equality is a SOUND stand-in for **RDF term equality** only if the
//! `Term -> Fp` encoding is **injective on the join domain**. A collision — two
//! distinct terms mapping to the same `Fp` — is a **false match**: the protocol
//! discloses a join row that does not exist in the plaintext answer, and the
//! differential tests CANNOT see it because they pick hand-injective small-int
//! keys by construction (the gap named in bead sq-dl81).
//!
//! Before this module the encoding was "the holder's untested responsibility".
//! This module replaces that with a **documented, uniform-output encoder** so the
//! injectivity question becomes a *quantified birthday bound over the field*
//! rather than an unstated assumption, plus a **collision-detection path**
//! ([`KeyEncoder`]) the holder can run over its own key domain to *prove*
//! injectivity for a concrete input set before any share crosses the wire.
//!
//! ## Construction
//!
//! `encode(term) = reduce_mod_p( SHA-512( DOMAIN_TAG ‖ ntriples(term) ) )`.
//!
//! - **Canonical pre-image.** The term is serialised in its **N-Triples**
//!   lexical form (oxrdf's [`std::fmt::Display`]): IRIs as `<…>`, literals as
//!   `"…"`, `"…"^^<dt>`, or `"…"@lang`, blank nodes as `_:id`, triple terms
//!   recursively. That serialisation is itself injective on terms *up to blank-
//!   node label* (see the caveat below), and crucially it disambiguates the
//!   VARIANTS — an IRI `<x>` and a plain literal `"x"` never share a pre-image —
//!   so the encoder cannot confuse a term-kind boundary.
//! - **Domain separation.** A fixed [`DOMAIN_TAG`] prefixes every pre-image so a
//!   `Term` hash can never coincide with some other SHA-512 use in the system
//!   (RFC-style domain separation; the same discipline the ZK estate uses).
//! - **Fold into the field.** The 64-byte digest is read as a big-endian `u128`
//!   over its first 16 bytes and reduced mod `p = 2^61 − 1`. SHA-512 output is
//!   (modelled as) uniform, so the reduced value is statistically uniform over
//!   the field; truncating to 128 bits before the reduction loses no security
//!   because the field is only 61 bits wide (see the birthday note).
//!
//! ## Injectivity & the birthday bound (state this honestly)
//!
//! The field has `p = 2^61 − 1` elements ([`crate::field::P`]). Under the random-
//! oracle model for SHA-512, the encoder's outputs are uniform over the field, so
//! over a set of `q` DISTINCT terms the probability that *some* two collide is the
//! classic birthday bound `≈ q² / (2·p) = q² / 2^62`. Concretely a collision
//! reaches 50 % only near `q ≈ 2^30.5 ≈ 1.86×10^9` distinct terms — **far** above
//! the viable hidden-join regime (`≤10³–10⁴ rows/holder`; see the `mpc-protocols`
//! skill). At `q = 10^4` the collision probability is `≈ 10^8 / 2^62 ≈ 2.2×10^-11`.
//!
//! This is a **statistical** bound, NOT a guarantee. Two honest consequences:
//!
//! 1. The encoder is **NOT a security claim by itself** — like the rest of the
//!    crate it is a substrate. The malicious-secure, in-circuit *encoding-
//!    correctness* proof (that the opened key equals `encode(term)` for the
//!    holder's actual term) is the M4 collaborative-proof job and is NOT done here
//!    (the bead calls this module its "on-ramp").
//! 2. A holder who needs an *exact* injectivity guarantee for its concrete key
//!    set — not just the birthday bound — runs [`KeyEncoder`], which detects any
//!    collision among the encoded terms and returns [`EncodeError::Collision`]
//!    (fail-closed) BEFORE the keys are secret-shared. This converts the residual
//!    birthday risk into a checkable precondition for the inputs actually used.
//!
//! ## Blank-node caveat
//!
//! Blank-node labels are scope-local: the same conceptual node may carry
//! different labels in different holders' graphs, and *different* nodes may share
//! a label. The N-Triples form encodes the **label**, so two holders joining on a
//! blank node will match iff their labels agree — which is the SPARQL term-
//! equality semantics for blank nodes anyway (no cross-graph blank-node identity).
//! Callers that need cross-graph blank-node identity must canonicalise labels
//! (e.g. via `sparq-canon`) BEFORE encoding; that is out of scope here and is
//! flagged, not silently assumed.

    // The `sha2` 0.10 -> 0.11 dependency bump changed the crate's *API* (the
    // `Digest`/`Output` types: `GenericArray` -> `hybrid-array::Array`), NOT the
    // SHA-2 *algorithm*. The other determinism tests above check only RELATIONAL
    // properties (same term => same key; distinct terms => distinct keys), which a
    // silent change in the underlying hash bytes would still satisfy. This test
    // pins the EXACT output bytes so any future drift in the hash line, the
    // `encode_term` construction, or oxrdf's N-Triples rendering fails closed.
    //
    // This is a dependency-maintenance regression guard. It is NOT a ZK/MPC
    // soundness or privacy claim: the hidden-value join's security rests on the
    // protocol and the (semi-honest, NOT externally audited -- see sq-qhy4)
    // analysis, not on these fixed vectors.
