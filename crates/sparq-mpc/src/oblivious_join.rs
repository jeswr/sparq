// [OPUS-4.8] sq-jnkm: oblivious result-size protection + match-bit aggregation
// output path for SET-returning hidden joins. Closes leaks L1 (true result
// cardinality) and L2 (the per-pair match graph / key fan-out) that the per-pair
// `HiddenValueJoin` open exposes, building on the oblivious shuffle substrate

// 4.8 fallback model — re-review when Fable returns.
//! Oblivious output path for set-returning hidden joins — **result-size
//! protection + match-bit aggregation** (bead sq-jnkm).
//!
//! ## The leak this closes, and why the per-pair join needs it
//!
//! [`crate::join::HiddenValueJoin`] hides the join KEY values but its output path
//! leaks two things RQ2a wants hidden (research record §4.1):
//!
//! - **L1 — final result cardinality.** It emits exactly the true number of
//!   matches; `canonicalize_rows` sorts but never pads. An observer of the
//!   protocol learns `|result|` exactly.
//! - **L2 — per-pair match graph / key fan-out.** `secure_equal` *opens* the
//!   masked product `m = d·r` for every `(i, j)` candidate pair; that open IS the
//!   match bit at `(i, j)`. The set of matching pairs is the bipartite match graph,
//!   which fingerprints the (hidden) key fan-out / multiplicity distribution.
//!
//! The standard oblivious-join output path (research record §4.3, "Private-key
//! join returning a SET") closes both with the substrate this module consumes:
//!
//! 1. compute a per-candidate **match bit** kept SECRET-SHARED (never opened
//!    per-pair → L2 destroyed at source);
//! 2. **oblivious-select** each candidate slot to `bit · real_tag + (1 − bit) · 0`
//!    so a non-match becomes an indistinguishable dummy;
//! 3. **oblivious-shuffle** ([`crate::oblivious::shuffle`]) the slot column so the
//!    output position reveals nothing about which input pair produced it (the
//!    residual access-pattern half of L2);
//! 4. reveal **exactly a public padded bound `B` of slots** — never the true match
//!    count (→ L1 bounded to `B`, not exact).
//!
//! ## What is SOUND TODAY vs what is honestly GATED
//!
//! The empirical-honesty line is the same one the substrate draws between its
//! sound shuffle and its degree-reduction-gated secret comparator.
//!
//! ### Sound today (shipped here)
//!
//! - **The oblivious output TRANSFORM** — steps 2–4 above — given a secret-shared
//!   match bit per candidate. The per-slot select `bit·real_tag` is a **single**
//!   Shamir multiplication ([`crate::shamir::mul_shares_raw`]) plus local adds: no
//!   multiplication CHAIN, so it needs **no degree reduction** and is buildable on
//!   the single-product backend — exactly like
//!   `crate::join::HiddenValueJoin::secure_equal`. The shuffle is the sound
//!   substrate; the padded-prefix reveal is a degree-`2t` open of `B` slots. This
//!   is the structural obliviousness the bead asks for, and it holds at the
//!   honest-majority Shamir layer.
//! - **The DISCLOSED-key candidate path** — [`oblivious_set_output`] /
//!   [`oblivious_join_output`] from a candidate whose match bit was decided by a
//!   **public / disclosed-key** equi-join (computed OUTSIDE the crypto core,
//!   convention #4). The bit is public so we lift it to a trivial sharing with NO
//!   secure comparison; the transform then hides, from the parties, *which*
//!   candidates matched and the exact count (only `B` is revealed). This is fully
//!   sound and shippable now.
//!
//! ### [OPUS-4.8] sq-xhaw — the HIDDEN-key match bit is now REALISED (gate landed)
//!
//! - **Deriving the secret match bit from genuinely-secret keys WITHOUT opening
//!   it.** Feeding step 1 in the HIDDEN-key regime needs a secure
//!   equality-to-SHARED-bit. That was previously gated on the BGW/DN
//!   **degree-reduction** round (bead **sq-dvuc**) and the secure-comparison
//!   machinery on it (bead **sq-rrz4**) — the same gate the substrate's secret-key
//!   sort sat behind. **Those have landed**, and
//!   [`crate::compare::secure_equal_to_bit`] now produces `[1{a == b}]` as a fresh
//!   degree-`t` secret-shared bit that is NEVER opened (a bit-decomposition + an
//!   AND-tree of secure multiplications). So the hidden-key entry point
//!   ([`oblivious_set_output_hidden_keys`]) and the row-carrying production path
//!   ([`crate::join::HiddenValueJoin::fully_oblivious_batched_join`]) feed that
//!   shared bit as a [`MatchBit::SecretShared`] selector — no per-pair open, the
//!   L2 match-graph leak is closed at the DECISION (not just at the output). This
//!   is honest-majority / semi-honest only; external soundness sign-off is still
//!   pending (sq-qhy4).
//!
//! ## Residual leakage (state it loudly — empirical-honesty rule)
//!
//! This is the **padded-bound** (exact-obliviousness) output, NOT differential
//! privacy (DP cardinality / ε-budget is the SEPARATE follow-up bead **sq-shk5**;
//! deliberately not done here).
//!
//! - **To the PARTIES / the protocol transcript:** the output reveals only the
//!   PUBLIC bound `B` and that the true count is `≤ B`. It does NOT reveal the true
//!   count, which slots matched, or which input pair produced which output row
//!   (the shuffle destroyed position→candidate linkage). L1 is bounded to `B`; L2
//!   is destroyed.
//! - **To the authorized RESULT RECIPIENT** (who must filter the tagged dummies to
//!   use the result): the true count IS learned — it equals the number of
//!   non-dummy rows after filtering. This is inherent to a padded-bound scheme: the
//!   consumer of a result set learns its size. Hiding the count from the *recipient*
//!   too is exactly the job of the DP cardinality mode (sq-shk5), which adds noise
//!   + extra dummies on top of this transform; it is out of scope here.
//! - **`B` itself is public and caller-agreed.** Choosing `B` too tight FAILS
//!   CLOSED (we never silently drop matches — a candidate count `> B` is an error,
//!   never a truncation that would corrupt the result); choosing it loose costs `B`
//!   opens. `B` leaks an upper bound on the result size by construction.
//! - **L3 (input cardinalities `|L|`, `|R|`) and the candidate count** are public
//!   (standard MPC assumption; research record §4.1). We do not claim to hide them.
//! - Malicious security is unchanged from the Shamir layer: at `n = 2t + 1` the
//!   degree-`2t` opens have zero RS redundancy (research record §4.1 D×A; bead
//!   sq-6d6g IT-MAC is the named fix). Semi-honest only.
//!
//! ## Communication / round cost (MODELLED — counted, not measured)
//!
//! [`ObliviousOutputCost`] reports what a real deployment would pay: `B` select
//! multiplications (one round, all in parallel), the shuffle's switch count +
//! depth ([`crate::oblivious::ShuffleCost`]) — with the switch count scaled by the
//! packed-entry WIDTH (tag + payload limbs), since a real secret-control shuffle
//! pays a conditional swap per field element per switch and the payloads ride
//! through the shuffle as secret limbs (Copilot review #93) — and `B` degree-`2t`
//! opens. No hard-coded numbers: derived from `B`, the payload width, and the
//! built network (AGENTS.md).

///    [`oblivious_set_output_hidden_keys`] / module docs.)
/// 2. **Build `B` slots.** Each of the `|candidates|` candidates becomes one slot;
///    if `|candidates| < B` we append pure-dummy slots (selector = shared 0) so the
///    revealed count is exactly `B` regardless of input.
/// 3. **Oblivious-select** each slot's selector against a real-tag sharing:
///    `tag_out = sel · real_tag` (one multiplication; a non-match has `sel = 0` so
///    the tag opens to the dummy sentinel `0`). The payload is encoded into
///    secret-shared `Fp` limbs that travel THROUGH the shuffle locked to the tag
///    (so the permutation is never opened — Copilot review #93).
/// 4. **Oblivious-shuffle** the (tag, payload-limbs) entry together so output
///    position is independent of input position (substrate `shuffle`).
/// 5. **Open exactly `B` tags** at degree `2t` (and the payload limbs in the same
///    shuffled order); emit [`OutputSlot::Row`] where the tag is the real sentinel,
///    [`OutputSlot::Dummy`] where it is `0`, and FAIL CLOSED on any other value.
///
/// ## Fail-closed bound contract
///
/// `B` must be `>= candidates.len()` so every candidate gets a slot — we NEVER
/// silently truncate candidates (that could drop a true match and corrupt the

///
/// ## Why the old "open the indices" trick leaked (and this does not)
///
/// The previous implementation attached a secret-shared *position index* `i` to
/// each slot, shuffled, then OPENED the shuffled indices to learn the permutation
/// and reorder cleartext payloads. That reveals the permutation π to the protocol
/// transcript; composed with the step-5 per-slot tag opens (which are
/// position-aligned to the SAME shuffled order), an observer maps each opened tag
/// back to its originating candidate `π(k)` and recovers the per-candidate match
/// pattern — exactly the L2 match-graph / fan-out leak this module exists to close.
/// Cleartext payloads cannot be co-permuted by a secret permutation without either
/// revealing the permutation or carrying the payload INSIDE the secret domain;
/// this function does the latter.
///
/// ## Mechanism
///
/// Each payload row is serialized ([`encode_payload_row`]) and packed into a
/// FIXED number of `Fp` limbs (`limb_capacity`, the max over all rows so every
/// entry has identical width — required by the shuffle network and revealing only
/// the public max payload length), with [`LIMB_END`] padding. Each limb is
/// secret-shared and packed into the shuffle entry AFTER the tag shares:
/// `[tag shares | limb₁ shares | … | limb_C shares]`. The substrate [`shuffle`]
/// permutes whole entries by a secret permutation; the limbs ride along locked to
/// their tag. At reveal, the caller opens the tag AND the payload limbs IN
/// SHUFFLED ORDER (never the permutation), then decodes the limbs back to the
/// row — so the only thing the transcript learns is the shuffled multiset of
/// (tag, payload), with no position→candidate linkage. Opening the payload at a
/// shuffled position discloses no more than the step-5 row open already does.
