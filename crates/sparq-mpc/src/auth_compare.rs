// [OPUS-4.8] sq-ka8m (sq-mnv5 residual; design Hole 4): MALICIOUS-SECURE secure
// greater-than over the decompose+compare chain. Every multiplication carries an
// IT-MAC (sq-km34.3, `MacSession::auth_mul`) and the boolean verdict is MAC-checked
// (sq-km34.4, `MacSession::mac_check`) BEFORE it is opened.
//! Honest-majority **malicious-with-abort** secure greater-than — the IT-MAC
//! upgrade of the semi-honest [`crate::compare`] comparison chain (Hole 4).
//!
//! ## What this closes (design `research/mpc-malicious-security-design.md` Hole 4)
//!
//! The semi-honest [`crate::compare::secure_greater_than`] is a deep arithmetic
//! circuit — bit-decompose each operand, then an MSB-first chain of secret ANDs /
//! bit-equalities — and **every** product routes through
//! [`crate::shamir::mul_shares_raw`] + [`crate::shamir::ShamirDealer::degree_reduce`].
//! Each is a place a malicious party can inject an *undetected* offset: a forged
//! product share (Hole 1) or a wrong `degree_reduce` re-sharing (Hole 2), the latter
//! undetectable by Reed–Solomon even at over-provisioned `n` because the tampering is
//! on the value being re-shared, not on the open. The comparison is the **worst
//! case** of the four holes (design §1, Hole 4): a chain of Holes 1 + 2 with a final
//! boolean open at minimal `n = 2t+1` where RS redundancy is zero.
//!
//! ## The fix (design §2.4 route (a) + §2.5)
//!
//! Carry an information-theoretic MAC `m_x = α·x` (under a session-global,
//! secret-shared `[α]` no party knows) through the WHOLE chain:
//!
//! - operand bits are shared as **authenticated** values
//!   ([`crate::shamir::MacSession::authenticated_share`]);
//! - the `[0]`/`[1]` accumulators (`gt`, `eq`) are authenticated constants
//!   ([`crate::shamir::MacSession::auth_const_sharing`]);
//! - every secret AND / bit-equality is an authenticated multiplication
//!   ([`crate::shamir::MacSession::auth_mul`], the §2.4 mult-then-reduce that also
//!   MAC-covers the `degree_reduce` re-sharing);
//! - all linear ops (`1 − b`, `+`, scaling) carry the MAC for FREE
//!   ([`crate::authenticated`] `auth_*`).
//!
//! Then, **before the verdict is opened**, run ONE batched random-challenge MAC-check
//! ([`crate::shamir::MacSession::mac_check`], §2.5) over the verdict (and any other
//! value the verdict's integrity depends on): open a leakage-free
//! `σ = Σ χ_j·[m_{y_j}] − (Σ χ_j·y_j)·[α]` and **abort iff `σ ≠ 0`**. A tamper in ANY
//! gate of the chain changes some value `y_j` away from the value whose MAC was
//! authenticated; the deviating party cannot fix the MAC consistently without knowing
//! the secret `α`, so the check fires with probability `≈ 1 − 2^{−61}` over `F_p`.
//! Crucially this works at the minimal `n = 2t+1` — soundness comes from the secret
//! `α`, not from RS over-determination (design §2.5, the reason RS could not close
//! Hole 1 / Hole 4 but the MAC can).
//!
//! ## Security tier (stated precisely, no over-claim)
//!
//! **Honest-majority, malicious-with-abort, unanimous abort** (design §3). On the
//! three-axis registry: AXIS-1 `Malicious` (the upgrade — [`crate::compare`] is
//! `SemiHonest`), AXIS-2 `Abort(Unanimous)` (detect-and-abort, NOT identifiable
//! abort, NOT GOD), AXIS-3 `HonestMajority` (unchanged; degrades / refuses if
//! `n ≤ 2t`). It does NOT enter the dishonest-majority SPDZ regime (route (b) /
//! sq-j5ok). The exact integer operands are NEVER opened — only the 1-bit verdict,
//! and only after the MAC-check passes. `[OPUS-4.8]`
