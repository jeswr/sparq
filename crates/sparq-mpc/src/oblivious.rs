// [OPUS-4.8] sq-18lk: oblivious shuffle (Waksman/Benes net) + oblivious sort
// substrate over Shamir F_p. Keystone hidden-regime primitive (ORQ SOSP'25): DISTINCT,
// ORDER BY, GROUP BY-over-hidden, MIN/MAX, OPTIONAL/MINUS, the set-returning
// oblivious-join output path, and ~linear joins all reduce to it. Native-only;
// in-process multi-party simulation; communication cost MODELLED not measured.
//! Oblivious shuffle + sort over secret-shared `F_p` vectors — the keystone
//! hidden-regime primitive (bead sq-18lk).
//!
//! ## Why this is the single highest-leverage primitive
//!
//! The unifying insight from relational MPC (ORQ SOSP'25 eprint 2025/1657,
//! Secrecy NSDI'23, Conclave, Senate, SMCQL — see
//! `research/mpc-security-models-and-benchmarks.md` §3) is that secure relational
//! evaluation is dominated by ONE primitive family: **oblivious shuffle + sort**.
//! Every set / dedup / order / group / outer operator reduces to a
//! *sort-then-linear-scan* so the pipeline costs `O(n log n)` work, `O(log n)`
//! rounds, `O(n)` memory (`n` = total input rows). This substrate is what unlocks,
//! against secret-shared (HIDDEN) operands:
//!
//! - **ORDER BY** — oblivious sort.
//! - **DISTINCT / dedup** — oblivious sort + adjacent-equality scan + compaction.
//! - **GROUP BY (hidden key)** — sort-on-key + segmented prefix scan.
//! - **MIN / MAX** — sort + extreme (or a comparison tournament).
//! - **OPTIONAL / MINUS / UNION** — the same sort-merge, different gating bits.
//! - **The set-returning oblivious-join OUTPUT path** — oblivious-SHUFFLE the
//!   matched rows then reveal only a padded prefix, so the per-pair match graph
//!   (leak L2, §4.1) is destroyed before anything opens.
//! - **~linear joins** — ORQ-style sort-merge join-aggregation (bead sq-ujz8),
//!   replacing the current `O(|L|·|R|)` all-pairs [`crate::join::HiddenValueJoin`].
//!
//! Those downstream operators are tracked as their own beads — this module is the
//! *substrate* they build on, not the operators themselves: see **sq-ujz8**
//! (ORQ-style oblivious sort-merge join-aggregation) and **sq-jnkm** (oblivious
//! result-size protection + match-bit aggregation, which consumes [`shuffle`]).
//!
//! ## What this module IS (sound today) vs what it scopes out (stated, not faked)
//!
//! ### Oblivious shuffle — REAL and sound at the honest-majority Shamir layer
//!
//! [`shuffle`] permutes a [`SecretColumn`] (a vector of full Shamir sharings) by a
//! **uniformly-random secret permutation** drawn from the masking CSPRNG
//! ([`crate::rng`]), routed through a **Waksman/Beneš permutation network**
//! ([`WaksmanNetwork`]). The output order is information-theoretically independent
//! of the input order to any party seeing `≤ t` shares, because:
//!
//! - the network *topology* (which wire pairs each switch acts on, at each layer)
//!   is **fixed by `n` alone — data-independent**; and
//! - the per-switch control bits realize a uniform random permutation and stay
//!   secret (in the simulation the routing layer holds them; in a real deployment
//!   they are jointly generated via PRSS — eprint 2021/1223 — and never opened).
//!
//! Crucially a switch over two *sharings* is a **swap of two share-vectors** —
//! pure local relabeling, **zero multiplications, stays degree `t`, needs no
//! degree reduction**. That is exactly why the shuffle is buildable today on the
//! current Shamir machinery (which has only a single non-reducing product —
//! [`crate::shamir::mul_shares_raw`]) whereas a generic secure comparator is not.
//! This is the standard oblivious shuffle (Waks-On/Waks-Off CCS'23, eprint
//! 2023/1236; we use the **full-support Waksman/Beneš network — NOT a network
//! that biases the realizable permutation distribution** (the "Benes — biased"
//! caveat the bead/design record §3 flag); full support is tested for small `n`).
//!
//! ### Oblivious sort — the SUBSTRATE (data-independent access pattern) is real;
//! ### the secret-key comparator is HONESTLY out of scope on this backend
//!
//! [`sort_by`] runs a **Batcher odd-even mergesort network** ([`SortingNetwork`]):
//! a `O(n log² n)` sequence of *compare-exchange* gates whose `(i, j)` index
//! sequence is **fixed by `n` alone** — completely independent of the secret data
//! (the load-bearing obliviousness property; the access pattern is asserted
//! data-independent in the tests). This network — the data-oblivious access
//! pattern — is the substrate the bead asks for, and it is real.
//!
//! Each compare-exchange needs a **secure comparison** `a < b` over two *secret*
//! `F_p` values plus a conditional swap. A secure comparison (Rabbit eprint
//! 2021/119 / edaBits Crypto'20) is a bit-decomposition that consumes a
//! **multiplication CHAIN**, which needs DN07/ATLAS **degree reduction** — and the
//! current backend has only a *single* non-reducing product (`mul_shares_raw`).
//! So a comparator over genuinely-secret values is **NOT buildable on this
//! backend yet** — it is gated on the BGW/DN degree-reduction round (bead
//! **sq-dvuc**) and the secure greater-than primitive built on it (bead
//! **sq-rrz4**); tracked, not faked. We therefore expose the sort against a
//! [`Comparator`] seam and ship two honest instantiations:
//!
//! - [`sort_with_keys`] — sorts rows by a **disclosed / public** sort key. The
//!   *values* stay secret-shared and are obliviously permuted; only the public
//!   keys drive the comparisons. This is the common DISCLOSED-regime case (§3: the
//!   verifier-recompute path) and is fully sound today.
//! - `SimulatedSecretComparator` — for the in-process simulation / differential
//!   tests ONLY (`#[cfg(any(test, feature = "insecure-test-rng"))]`): it
//!   reconstructs the two values to compare. **This LEAKS the comparison result
//!   and is NOT secure** — it stands in for the unbuilt secure comparator purely
//!   so the sort *network* and its obliviousness (the substrate) can be tested
//!   end-to-end. Its name and gate are the warning; no security is claimed.
//!
//! This is the empirical-honesty line the design record demands: the **shuffle**
//! and the **sort network / access-pattern obliviousness** are delivered for real;
//! the **secret-key comparator** is truthfully gated on degree reduction rather
//! than faked.
//!
//! ## Communication / round complexity (MODELLED — the crate is an in-process
//! ## simulation; these are counted, NOT measured)
//!
//! [`ShuffleCost`] / [`SortCost`] report the cost a REAL deployment would pay, per
//! the design record §5.2 metric triple (rounds, bytes/party, switch/compare
//! count). The simulation runs in one process so wall-clock here is NOT an MPC
//! latency; only these counts are load-bearing:
//!
//! - **Shuffle (Waksman/Beneš, `n` items):** `O(n log n)` conditional swaps;
//!   network **depth** `2·⌈log₂ n⌉ − 1` layers → that many communication rounds when
//!   control bits are secret-shared (a swap of two *cleartext-control* sharings is
//!   local — 0 rounds — but a real shuffle uses secret control bits, 1 mult per
//!   switch). Comm scales with the share width crossing the party boundary.
//! - **Sort (Batcher odd-even mergesort, `n` items):** `O(n log² n)`
//!   compare-exchange gates in `O(log² n)` layers (rounds), each gate one secure
//!   comparison + one conditional swap.
//!
//! No hard-coded performance numbers live in markdown (AGENTS.md): these are the
//! analytic complexity, recomputed from `n` by [`ShuffleCost::model`] /
//! [`SortCost`], not a measured benchmark figure.
