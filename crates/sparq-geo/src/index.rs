//! [`GeoIndex`]: an R-tree over the geometries of a sparq [`Graph`].
//!
//! ## Extraction (GeoSPARQL core RDF shape)
//!
//! [`GeoIndex::build`] scans the graph's `geo:asWKT` triples — in the DEFAULT
//! graph and in every NAMED graph ([`Graph::named`]). For each
//! `(?g, geo:asWKT, "..."^^geo:wktLiteral)` the indexed ENTITY is every
//! feature `?f` with `?f geo:hasGeometry ?g` or `?f geo:hasDefaultGeometry
//! ?g` (resolved within the same graph); when a geometry node has no owning
//! feature the geometry node itself is the entity (datasets often attach
//! `geo:asWKT` straight to the thing). Each [`Entry`] records which graph it
//! came from ([`Entry::graph`], `None` for the default graph) and its
//! `geo:asWKT` subject ([`Entry::node`]). Literals that fail to parse, are
//! EMPTY, carry a non-geographic CRS, or are not `geo:wktLiteral`-typed are
//! counted in [`GeoIndex::skipped`] rather than aborting the build.
//!
//! ## Index design
//!
//! Entries live in a slotted `Vec` (slots are tombstoned by incremental
//! deletes and reused by inserts); the R-tree (`rstar::RTree`, bulk-loaded —
//! packed STR build, O(n log n)) stores one `{entry slot, AABB}` leaf per
//! geometry, in LONG/LAT DEGREE space. Queries prune by bounding box in the
//! tree and then refine against the actual geometry:
//!
//! - [`within_distance`](GeoIndex::within_distance) — converts the metre
//!   radius into one or two pole-safe long/lat windows (a ball CROSSING THE
//!   ANTIMERIDIAN is split into two windows, one per side of ±180°), walks
//!   `locate_in_envelope_intersecting` per window, refines with the true
//!   great-circle distance ([`geof::point_to_geometry_meters`]).
//! - [`nearest`](GeoIndex::nearest) — expanding-radius search over
//!   `within_distance` (radius ×4 per round, seeded from the tree's own
//!   extent), exact under the same great-circle metric (and antimeridian-safe
//!   through `within_distance`).
//! - [`intersects`](GeoIndex::intersects) — window query on the argument's
//!   AABB refined with `geo::Intersects` (degree space). The argument's OWN
//!   coordinates are taken as written: a geometry whose WKT runs past ±180°
//!   is not wrapped (the refinement is planar in degree space either way).
//!
//! ## Incremental maintenance
//!
//! [`apply_delta`](GeoIndex::apply_delta) mirrors a [`Graph::apply_delta`]
//! batch into the index without a rebuild: the geometry nodes touched by the
//! batch are re-extracted from the (post-delta) graph, their old entries
//! removed from the R-tree (`rstar` incremental remove) and the new state
//! inserted (`rstar` incremental insert) — O(batch × log n) instead of the
//! O(n log n) rebuild. Deltas apply to the DEFAULT graph (sparq's
//! `Graph::apply_delta` semantics); named-graph entries are untouched.
