//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-9h1r — OGC GeoSPARQL compliance ratchet.
//!
//! A fixture-gated, pass-count **ratchet** over a corpus of OGC GeoSPARQL
//! conformance-style assertions: each fixture is a geometry pair, a `geof:`
//! topology relation, and the expected boolean per the OGC GeoSPARQL
//! specification (1.0 Req 22/25/26, 1.1 §9–10). The harness runs every
//! assertion, counts passes, and enforces TWO invariants:
//!
//! 1. zero regressions — every fixture currently asserted MUST pass
//!    (`assert_eq!(fail, 0)`), so a relation that starts disagreeing with the
//!    hand-checked OGC truth value is a hard failure; and
//! 2. a pass-count FLOOR ([`OGC_RATCHET_FLOOR`]) that may only RISE — mirrors
//!    the SHACL W3C ratchet (`crates/sparq-shacl/tests/w3c_sparql.rs`) and the
//!    conformance-suite ratchets, so deleting coverage below the recorded floor
//!    fails the build.
//!
//! This is a HAND-CURATED conformance set, NOT the official OGC TEAM Engine /
//! CITE test suite (that suite is a Java/HTTP harness over a live endpoint and
//! is not vendored here). The fixtures are modelled on the relation semantics
//! the OGC Simple Features / GeoSPARQL DE-9IM patterns define; the expected
//! booleans are derived by hand from those matrices.
//!
//! ## OGC sub-conformance classes EXERCISED here
//!
//! * **Topology vocabulary extension — Simple Features (`geof:sf*`)**: all eight
//!   relations (`sfEquals` `sfDisjoint` `sfIntersects` `sfTouches` `sfCrosses`
//!   `sfWithin` `sfContains` `sfOverlaps`) over point / line / polygon operands,
//!   in BOTH operand orders where the relation is order-sensitive.
//! * **Topology vocabulary extension — Egenhofer (`geof:eh*`)**: all eight
//!   (`ehEquals` `ehDisjoint` `ehMeet` `ehOverlap` `ehCovers` `ehCoveredBy`
//!   `ehInside` `ehContains`) over REGION (polygon) pairs.
//! * **Topology vocabulary extension — RCC8 (`geof:rcc8*`)**: all eight
//!   (`rcc8eq` `rcc8dc` `rcc8ec` `rcc8po` `rcc8tpp` `rcc8tppi` `rcc8ntpp`
//!   `rcc8ntppi`) over region pairs.
//! * **Geometry serialization equivalence (GeoSPARQL §8.5)**: a subset of the
//!   sf fixtures is ALSO run with one operand supplied as a `geo:gmlLiteral`
//!   (GML-SF), asserting the WKT and GML serializations yield identical
//!   topology results (the `gml_equivalence` test).
//!
//! ## OGC sub-conformance classes NOT exercised here (tracked as beads)
//!
//! * The official OGC CITE / TEAM-Engine conformance suite itself (live-endpoint
//!   HTTP harness) — not vendored.
//! * The RDFS/OWL **Geometry / Feature class** entailment requirements
//!   (`geo:Feature`, `geo:Geometry`, the `geo:hasGeometry` reasoning rules) —
//!   now covered by `tests/entailment.rs` (sq-5ts8), which drives the generic
//!   `sparq-reason` RDFS/OWL-RL closure over the GeoSPARQL ontology axioms.
//! * The **query rewrite extension** (the `geo:sfWithin`-style triple-pattern
//!   property forms, as opposed to the `geof:` filter functions tested here) —
//!   NOT implemented; the gap is pinned by `tests/entailment.rs` (sq-5ts8).
//! * Non-topological `geof:` functions (`distance`, `buffer`, set operations,
//!   `boundary`/`envelope`/`convexHull`) — covered by `tests/relations.rs`, not
//!   this topology ratchet.
