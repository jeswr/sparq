//! Entity & relation linking — mapping a question's mentions to concrete IRIs in the
//! store, then expanding each linked entity with its structurally-similar siblings.
//!
//! This is the **index-grounded linking** step of the design
//! (`research/genai-nl-to-sparql.md` §2.6 "Entity & relation linking", §8.3
//! "Index-grounded entity/relation linking with cardinality priors"): the prompt's
//! schema summary tells the model what *classes and predicates* exist, but not which
//! concrete IRIs the question's proper nouns ("Tarantino", "France") resolve to. Without
//! that, value-bound and entity-bound queries can only be guessed. Linking closes the
//! **entity gap** (§2, gap 2) cheaply, with no model and no network:
//!
//! 1. **Mention generation** — the question is split into word n-grams (1..=3 words);
//!    very short tokens and a small stop-word set are dropped from unigrams.
//! 2. **Lexical entity linking** — a once-built `lowercased label → entity` index over
//!    the common label predicates (`rdfs:label`, `skos:prefLabel`, `schema:name`,
//!    `foaf:name`, `dc:title`, `dcterms:title`) resolves a mention to candidate
//!    entities; exact label equality outranks containment, and rarer (higher-IDF) label
//!    predicates outrank `rdfs:label`. **A verbatim full-label hit short-circuits first**
//!    (`sq-26fdp`): when the WHOLE input is itself an entire label — case/whitespace
//!    normalised, punctuation preserved — it binds that one entity exactly *before* the
//!    token n-gram path can split it into shared tokens, so a phrase that IS a `prefLabel`
//!    (e.g. `"ZK/MPC claim + circuit discipline"`) never goes ambiguous.
//! 3. **Structural expansion (sparq-sim)** — each linked entity is expanded with its
//!    top structurally-similar siblings via [`sparq_sim::Sim::most_similar`] (the wiring
//!    `sq-uw40` calls for), so the model sees a few worked examples of the entity's
//!    *shape* — the predicates it participates in and a sibling it resembles.
//! 4. **Relation linking** — mentions are matched against predicate IRI local-names
//!    (camelCase split), ranked by triple count (the cardinality prior of §8.3).
//! 5. **Exact dictionary linking** (`sq-na0q`, opt-in via [`EntityLinker::with_values`])
//!    — the *lexical/exact* complement to the structural tiers above. Two probes, both
//!    straight into the store's dictionary:
//!    * **literal values** — a mention that IS, verbatim, the lexical form of a literal
//!      the store holds resolves to that literal with its **datatype and language tag
//!      intact** (`"1994"^^xsd:gYear`, `"France"@en`), plus the predicates it is used
//!      with. Without this the model can only guess a lexical form, and a guessed form
//!      matches no triple — which is why value-bound / `FILTER` questions fail in
//!      practice even with a perfect schema card.
//!    * **verbatim IRIs** — an IRI written out in the question is probed directly with
//!      [`sparq_core::Graph::id_of`] and, when present, bound exactly (no label needed,
//!      so entities the label index cannot see are still linkable).
//!
//! The result is rendered as a compact prompt section ([`Linking::to_prompt_section`])
//! appended to the schema summary. Everything is read-only over the public `sparq-core`
//! API; the index is built once per [`crate::Nlq`] and reused across `ask` calls.
