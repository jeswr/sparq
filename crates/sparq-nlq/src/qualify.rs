//! **Answer-qualification: hedge + abstention** (GenAI-KB Phase 2, `sq-2489d.2`, Use 2).
//!
//! This is the second consumer of the Phase-1 cross-cutting provenance join
//! ([`crate::provenance`]). Where [`crate::cite`] turns the join into *citations*, this
//! module turns the **same** resolved `pkg:assurance` / `pkg:confidence` axes into an
//! **answer-level qualification** — an honest hedge over the answer, and, below a
//! configurable floor, an **abstention**:
//!
//! - **`pkg:assurance` → a verb hedge.** All supporting bindings `secx:Proven` → an
//!   assertive verb; any `secx:Claimed` → "appears to be (claimed)"; any
//!   `secx:Conjectured`, or missing assurance, → "may be" (the weakest epistemic basis
//!   present dominates — the answer is only as strong as its weakest cited support).
//! - **`pkg:confidence` → a verbal band.** The *minimum* asserted confidence across the
//!   supporting bindings maps to High / Medium / Low against
//!   [`QualifyConfig`]-configured thresholds (again, weakest-link).
//! - **`min_confidence` → an abstention floor.** When the minimum supporting confidence
//!   is *below* the floor — or no supporting binding carries confidence at all and
//!   [`QualifyConfig::abstain_when_unprovenanced`] is set — the qualified answer
//!   **abstains** ("insufficient confidence to answer") rather than asserting.
//!
//! ## The load-bearing honesty invariants
//!
//! 1. **Weakest-link, never best-case.** The band and the verb hedge are driven by the
//!    *minimum* confidence and the *weakest* assurance present, so adding one
//!    low-confidence supporting binding can only *lower* the qualification, never raise
//!    it. (`research/provenance-driven-genai-kb.md` §5 Phase 2: "the verbal band tracks
//!    asserted `pkg:assurance` monotonically".)
//! 2. **Reflects asserted assurance — NOT "calibrated confidence".** The verbal band is a
//!    monotone reading of *hand-authored* `pkg:confidence` estimates; it is **not** a
//!    calibrated probability. No "calibrated confidence" is claimed here, and none should
//!    be, until a reliability-diagram measurement on calibrated confidences exists
//!    (design §5 Phase 2 / §0 honesty rule). [OPUS-4.8]
//! 3. **Fail-closed.** A subject with no provenance contributes the *weakest* assurance
//!    (`Missing`) and no confidence — it can only pull the answer toward abstention, never
//!    toward over-confidence. Over a no-provenance graph the honest default is to hedge
//!    maximally (and, with `abstain_when_unprovenanced`, to abstain).
//!
//! ## What this is NOT
//!
//! This does not *estimate* a confidence — it *reads* the symbolic `pkg:confidence` /
//! `pkg:assurance` the graph asserts (the design's "direct, symbolic evidence-uncertainty
//! signal", §5 Use 2). An answer over a graph that asserts no quality axes is hedged to
//! the weakest band — never silently asserted with invented confidence.
