//! [FABLE-5] (epic `sq-tag1q`, child `sq-tag1q.7.2`) SPARQL-CRDT **codec +
//! journal** layer for sparq: the bounded, versioned canonical delta envelope,
//! causal summaries, the durable append/recovery journal, snapshots,
//! missing-interval exchange primitives, and membership-epoch /
//! causal-stability tracking from `research/sparql-crdt-gpt56-2026-07.md`
//! (§4.1, §6, §8) and the proposal draft `site/specs/sparql-crdt.typ`.
//!
//! # What this crate is (and is not)
//!
//! This is the **interchange and durability** layer of the SPARQL-CRDT design:
//!
//! * [`ReplicaId`] / [`DatasetId`] / [`Dot`] — the identifier contract
//!   (research §4.1);
//! * [`CausalSummary`] — the compact `clock` (version vector) + `cloud`
//!   (sparse dots) causal-context representation, used both for **data** dots
//!   and for **envelope-identity** journal frontiers;
//! * [`DeltaEnvelope`] — the bounded canonical envelope with its strict codec:
//!   decode **rejects** non-canonical bytes, oversized input, wrong-dataset,
//!   wrong-epoch, unknown versions, blank-node quads, and duplicate dots
//!   rather than normalising them;
//! * [`Journal`] — an append-only, checksummed, crash-recovering envelope log
//!   that serves missing intervals to peers and supports compaction beneath a
//!   snapshot;
//! * [`Snapshot`] — dataset id, dot store, causal context, journal frontier,
//!   and causal-stability frontier under one content hash, with atomic
//!   write/read helpers;
//! * [`SyncHello`], [`missing_intervals`], [`StabilityTracker`] — the peer
//!   handshake and reconciliation primitives of research §6.2 and the
//!   membership-epoch / causal-stability frontier rule of research §4.3.
//!
//! The replicated **dot-store state and merge algebra** (join), the
//! **evaluate-at-origin SPARQL Update compiler**, and the sparq-core
//! materialisation adapter are sibling beads of epic `sq-tag1q.7` and are
//! **not** in this crate yet, so the crate is `publish = false` and claims no
//! conformance class from the proposal draft. Convergence, atomic-visibility,
//! and admission-policy properties of the full design are therefore **not**
//! claims made by this crate; it supplies the byte formats and durability
//! those beads build on.
//!
//! # Canonical form
//!
//! Every wire document (envelope, journal header, snapshot payload, sync
//! hello) is a canonical JSON text in the RFC 8785 (JCS) subset this crate
//! emits: object keys sorted, no insignificant whitespace, all scalars encoded
//! as strings (counters as shortest-form decimal, replica identifiers as
//! unpadded base64url), arrays sorted and duplicate-free as the proposal
//! (`CRDT-WIRE-2/3`) requires. Decoding parses strictly, re-encodes, and
//! **byte-compares** against the input, so exactly one byte representation of
//! an identity is ever accepted (`CRDT-UPD-RETRY-1`).
//!
//! The envelope carries a `membership_epoch` field (research §6.1) that the
//! proposal draft's envelope sketch does not yet show; freezing it is decision
//! 5 of research §11 and admission rejects a wrong-epoch envelope here, as the
//! implementation bead requires.
//!
//! # Dependencies
//!
//! Only existing, attested workspace dependencies are used (`oxrdf` + `oxttl`
//! for quad validation, `serde_json` as the strict JSON reader, `sha2` for
//! checksums/content hashes); this bead adds no new supply-chain surface.
