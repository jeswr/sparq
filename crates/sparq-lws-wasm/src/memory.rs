// [SONNET-4.6] sq-wubkf: bounded linear-memory accounting + per-request admission control.
//! Bounded linear-memory accounting for the wasm pod.
//!
//! # The failure this removes
//!
//! On `wasm32` the whole pod lives in one linear memory. When the heap needs to grow past the
//! host's ceiling, `memory.grow` returns `-1`, the allocator hands back a null pointer, and Rust's
//! allocation-error handler aborts — which under the release profile's `panic=abort` lowers to an
//! `unreachable` trap. The host sees a `WebAssembly.RuntimeError`, the instance is poisoned, and
//! the request that tripped it gets no HTTP answer at all (the Node host recycles the instance and
//! synthesises a 503; see `packages/solid-server/src/trap-recovery.js`).
//!
//! [`BoundedAlloc`] plus [`admits_request`] turn the common, *sustained*-pressure form of that
//! failure into a clean HTTP 507 instead: the allocator keeps a running total of live heap bytes,
//! and a request whose projected peak footprint would cross the configured ceiling is refused
//! before it ever reaches the router.
//!
//! # Why the allocator accounts instead of failing allocations
//!
//! A "bounded" allocator that returns null once a ceiling is crossed does **not** help here.
//! [`std::alloc::GlobalAlloc::alloc`] returning null routes straight into `handle_alloc_error`,
//! which aborts — i.e. it produces exactly the trap this module exists to remove, only sooner.
//! Refusing allocations is therefore strictly worse than not refusing them. The bound is instead
//! enforced one layer up, at the request boundary, which is the only place a refusal can still be
//! expressed as an HTTP status.
//!
//! # What this does and does not catch
//!
//! It catches *sustained* pressure: a pod whose retained bytes have crept up to the ceiling refuses
//! further writes with 507. Because the accounting is of **live** bytes rather than of pages ever
//! grown, bytes returned to the allocator lower the total again and restore headroom — something a
//! pages-grown high-water mark could never do.
//!
//! That is a property of the *counters*, and it is all the tests below pin. Whether a given LDP
//! `DELETE` returns **enough** bytes to move a refused request back under the ceiling is **not**
//! measured: nothing here instruments the store, which keeps its map capacity after removing an
//! entry, and the wasm integration test restores the ceiling rather than deleting data. Recovery
//! from sustained pressure is therefore the accounting's intent, not a demonstrated property of
//! the delete path; establishing it needs a wasm32 end-to-end test that deletes a stored resource
//! and observes admission return under an unchanged ceiling.
//!
//! It does **not** catch a single request whose own transient peak overshoots the remaining
//! headroom by more than [`projected_request_bytes`] predicts; only fallible allocation throughout
//! the router could do that, which is not available on stable Rust. Such a request still traps and
//! is still handled by the host's trap-recovery path.
//!
//! # Host-testability
//!
//! Everything except the one `#[global_allocator]` registration is target-independent and compiled
//! on the host, so the arithmetic and the ceiling policy are covered by ordinary `cargo test`. The
//! crate's wasm-only glue merely reads these values.
