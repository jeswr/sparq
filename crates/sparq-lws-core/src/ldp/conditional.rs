// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8
//! HTTP conditional-request preconditions (`If-Match` / `If-None-Match`) over the strong ETag.
//!
//! This is pure value logic (no I/O): given a request's precondition headers and the resource's
//! current ETag (or its absence, when the resource does not exist), it decides whether a mutating
//! request may proceed (RFC 9110 §13.1–§13.2). The handler holds the I/O; this module holds the
//! exact comparison rules so they are exhaustively unit-testable.
//!
//! The server emits only **strong** ETags (`"…"`). Validator strength is honoured per RFC 9110:
//! `If-Match` uses **strong comparison** (§13.1.1 — "the server MUST NOT … weak"), so an inbound
//! weak validator (`W/"…"`) can NEVER satisfy `If-Match` and the request fails; `If-None-Match` uses
//! **weak comparison** (§13.1.2), so a `W/`-prefixed validator matches by its opaque tag. The
//! wildcard `*` is handled per spec: `If-None-Match: *` ⇒ "only if it does NOT exist" (the create
//! guard); `If-Match: *` ⇒ "only if it DOES exist".
//!
//! ## Representation-variant tags: `"<state>+<variant>"`
//!
//! An entity-tag identifies a **representation**, not a resource (RFC 9110 §8.8.3). This server
//! stores ONE representation per resource but content-negotiates RDF (Turtle ↔ JSON-LD), so a GET
//! whose negotiated format differs from the stored one is served a DIFFERENT representation — and
//! must carry a different validator, or a client holding the Turtle tag would get a spurious 304
//! for a JSON-LD body it never saw. The handler therefore mints [`variant_etag`]: the stored
//! (state) tag plus a `+<variant>` suffix inside the quotes (`"7-1a2b"` → `"7-1a2b+jsonld"`). The
//! base tags this server mints (`"<len>-<hash>"`) never contain `+`, so the suffix is unambiguous.
//!
//! The two comparison audiences then differ deliberately:
//!
//! - **Read preconditions** ([`evaluate_read`]) compare EXACTLY against the negotiated
//!   representation's tag — a Turtle tag never 304s a JSON-LD response.
//! - **Write preconditions** ([`evaluate`]) compare the **STATE part** (the tag with any
//!   `+<variant>` suffix stripped): every negotiated variant of one stored state is equally
//!   current, so a client may round-trip `GET` (any `Accept`) → `If-Match` PUT/PATCH/DELETE with
//!   the ETag it received. A write conditional guards resource STATE, not the wire format the
//!   client happened to read it in.
