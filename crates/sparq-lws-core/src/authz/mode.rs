// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8
//! Web Access Control access modes + the HTTP-method → required-mode mapping.
//!
//! The four WAC modes are NOT hierarchical in the data model (an ACL grants each explicitly), but
//! `Write` subsumes `Append` (an agent who may write a container may also append to it) and `Control`
//! governs the resource's own `.acl`. The handler maps each HTTP operation to the single mode it
//! requires; reading/writing an `.acl` resource always requires `Control`.
//!
//! Ported (semantics, not code) from prod-solid-server `src/authz/mode.ts` + `types.ts`.

/// The access modes Web Access Control distinguishes.
