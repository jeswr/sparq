//! The blob (byte) store seam.
//!
//! Per the architecture, `object_store`/S3 is **backup-only** for resource bytes: SPARQ is the
//! authoritative index, and the blob store holds a durable copy of the bytes keyed by an opaque
//! `s3Key`. This module defines the [`BlobStore`] trait and an in-memory test impl. The real
//! `object_store`-backed impl (S3 / Local) is an M2 adapter behind the same trait.

///   index row has not yet committed (the write-in-progress race) is protected. Backends that do not
///   expose a timestamp must report `None` and are then NEVER GC'd by the reconciler (fail-closed — we
///   can't prove an undated blob is old enough to be safe to delete).
///
/// - `generation` is the CAS WITNESS for [`BlobStore::delete_if_unchanged`]. A `SystemTime` is NOT a
///   unique write version — two same-key writes can collide on a timestamp (clock granularity, a clock
///   rollback, coarse backend precision), so a same-timestamp recreate landing between the reconciler's
///   fresh stat and its delete could slip past a `last_modified`-only CAS and be clobbered. The

///   generation regardless of the clock, so the reconciler can compare-and-delete on it race-free and
