// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8
//! Transport-layer DoS hardening — HTTP/2 stream/reset caps + slowloris header timeout + a global AND
//! a per-source concurrent-connection cap + TLS-handshake timeout + a per-connection idle-keepalive
//! timeout + a max-requests-per-connection reuse cap.
//!
//! ## Why (the transport-DoS gap the application layers leave open)
//! The overload layers ([`crate::overload`]) and the per-IP rate limiter ([`crate::rate_limit`]) gate
//! **admitted requests** — they sit ABOVE hyper, so they only ever see a fully-parsed `http::Request`.
//! Several DoS classes never produce such a request, so those layers never fire:
//! - **HTTP/2 Rapid-Reset (CVE-2023-44487).** A client opens a stream and immediately `RST_STREAM`s
//!   it, in a tight loop, over one connection. Each stream creates + cancels server-side work without
//!   the connection's concurrent-stream count ever rising — bypassing a `max_concurrent_streams`
//!   limit, and never reaching the application admission layer (the request is reset before it
//!   completes). The defence is at the h2 layer: cap the number of in-flight *reset* streams and
//!   `GOAWAY` when exceeded, AND bound `max_concurrent_streams` so a single connection cannot pin
//!   unbounded server work.
//! - **Slowloris (slow-header trickle).** A client opens a TCP connection and dribbles request-header
//!   bytes one at a time, never completing the head. The [`crate::overload`] request *timeout* covers
//!   total request time AFTER the request is parsed — it never starts, because hyper is still reading
//!   the head. The defence is a **header-read timeout** at the hyper layer (drop a connection that
//!   has not sent a complete header set in time) plus a **concurrent-connection cap** so a flood of
//!   such half-open connections cannot exhaust file descriptors / memory, plus a bounded **TLS
//!   handshake timeout** so a connection that stalls the handshake (never completing it) cannot pin a
//!   connection permit, and an **h2 keep-alive PING** (interval + ack-timeout) so a DEAD-peer h2
//!   connection (host gone without a FIN) that is holding a permit is reclaimed. The global cap alone
//!   lets ONE source hold ALL the slots, so it is paired with a **per-source (per-IP) connection cap**
//!   (default-on, internal-IP-exempt — see [`ConnectionLimiter::with_per_ip_cap`]) so a single IP's
//!   half-open flood is bounded well below the global ceiling.
//! - **Slow-body (slow-POST trickle).** A client sends a complete header set (so `header_read_timeout`
//!   is satisfied) then dribbles the request BODY one byte at a time. hyper exposes NO server-side
//!   body-read timeout knob, so this is bounded by the composition of the OTHER layers rather than a
//!   dedicated one: the [`crate::overload`] **request timeout** (default 30s) caps the TOTAL request
//!   time including the body read, the explicit [`crate::body_limit`] **body-size cap** (default 2 MiB)
//!   bounds how many bytes a single slow body can ever be, and the connection caps bound how many such
//!   trickles a source may hold at once. Together these bound a slow-body attacker to
//!   `≤ body_limit` bytes over `≤ request_timeout`, on `≤ max_per_ip` connections — a finite, small
//!   resource footprint. (A dedicated min-throughput body reader is deliberately NOT hand-rolled: it
//!   would duplicate what the request timeout already guarantees and add a bespoke body-stream wrapper
//!   to the hot path.)
//! - **Idle keep-alive hold (the two missing-guard companions).** Two further gaps the bounds above
//!   leave open, both enforced here (NOT hyper builder knobs — hyper 1.x exposes neither; see below):
//!   - a peer that completes a request, gets its response, then holds the keep-alive connection open
//!     sending NOTHING further — `header_read_timeout` only bounds a PARTIAL head (bytes started), and
//!     the h2 PING only reclaims a DEAD peer, so neither closes a LIVE peer on a fully-idle connection.
//!     The defence is a per-connection **idle-keepalive timeout** at the IO layer ([`IdleTimeoutStream`]):
//!     no read/write progress for the window ⇒ close + reclaim the permit. It is **DEFAULT-OFF** — an
//!     IO-layer idle bound cannot exclude an UPGRADED long-lived stream (a WebSocketChannel2023 receive
//!     socket that sits quiet until a notification), so it is opt-in (roborev High).
//!   - unbounded keep-alive REUSE of one connection — bounded by a **max-requests-per-connection** cap
//!     ([`MaxRequestsService`]) that sets `Connection: close` after N requests (HTTP/1.1 reuse
//!     rotation; default OFF).
//!
//! ## What hyper provides vs what we add (the rapid-reset accounting)
//! The in-tree `hyper` 1.x + `h2` 0.4.x already ship the CVE-2023-44487 reset-accounting:
//! - `max_pending_accept_reset_streams` (hyper issue #2877) — defaults to **20**: a connection that
//!   accumulates more than this many streams that were reset before being accepted gets a `GOAWAY`.
//!   This is the PRIMARY rapid-reset cap and is ON BY DEFAULT.
//! - `max_local_error_reset_streams` (RUSTSEC-2024-0003) — defaults to **1024**: bounds locally-reset
//!   streams kept for error propagation.
//!
//! So an UNCONFIGURED hyper is already not vulnerable to the original rapid-reset CVE. What this
//! module ADDS on top is: making the cap an EXPLICIT, env-tunable, TESTED invariant of THIS crate
//! (so a dependency bump cannot silently change it), and pairing it with an explicit
//! `max_concurrent_streams` ceiling (hyper's default is 200; we set it explicitly so it is owned +
//! documented). The reset cap stays at hyper's secure default unless an operator overrides it.
//!
//! ## Where it sits (TLS serve path ONLY)
//! These knobs live BELOW the application layers — they configure the hyper connection serving the
//! request. They are applied **only on the in-process TLS serve path**: the h2/header knobs via
//! `axum-server`'s `http_builder()` (the `hyper_util::server::conn::auto::Builder` it serves with),
//! and the connection cap + handshake timeout + the per-connection **idle-keepalive read timeout**
//! (IO-layer [`IdleTimeoutStream`]) + the **max-requests-per-connection** cap (service-layer
//! [`MaxRequestsService`]) via the [`ConnectionLimitAcceptor`] wrapping `axum-server`'s acceptor — the
//! last two are NOT hyper builder knobs (hyper 1.x exposes neither a per-connection idle timeout nor a
//! request-count cap), so they are owned here at the per-connection accept seam. The **plain-HTTP path
//! is intentionally NOT hardened here** — `axum::serve`
//! exposes neither the underlying hyper builder nor an acceptor seam, so these knobs cannot be wired
//! onto it; an operator who needs the transport caps must terminate TLS in-process (or front the
//! plain path with a reverse proxy that caps connections + terminates HTTP/2). The startup log states
//! which posture is active per serve mode. On the plain path the application-layer defences (admission
//! control, per-IP rate limit, request timeout) still apply.
//!
//! These knobs are purely transport-level: they change WHEN/WHETHER a connection is served, never the
//! LDP/auth/WAC semantics of a request that IS served — so conformance is unaffected (the caps are
//! deliberately lenient enough never to trip the harness's own concurrency; see the defaults).

// --- Idle-keepalive timeout (IO-layer read-inactivity bound) --------------------------------------

/// An IO stream that enforces a per-connection **idle-activity timeout**: if NO read OR write progress
/// is made for the configured window, the next `poll_read` resolves to an `io::Error` (kind `TimedOut`),
/// which hyper surfaces as a connection close — reclaiming the connection (and its [`ConnectionLimiter`]
/// permit, via the outer [`PermittedStream`]). When the timeout is `None` it is a transparent
/// pass-through (zero overhead — no timer is created).
///
/// ## Request-aware — the idle clock is PAUSED while an HTTP exchange is in flight
/// The bound is genuinely an *idle-BETWEEN-requests* bound: it fires ONLY when NO HTTP exchange is in
/// flight. Via a shared per-connection [`InFlightGuard`] count (raised by [`MaxRequestsService`] from the
/// moment a request is dispatched until its response body has fully drained — see `in_flight`), the idle
/// clock is PAUSED for the whole exchange. So a slow handler (a >window SPARQ/S3 backend call), a slow
/// PUT that trickles its body between chunks, or a streaming GET stalled on client backpressure is NEVER
/// severed by this bound — it can only close a connection that is quiet AND has no request/response in
/// flight. (This request-awareness is what the earlier "never kills a legitimately slow link" claim now
/// actually delivers.)
///
/// ## ⚠️ DEFAULT-OFF — the POST-UPGRADE streaming-connection caveat (roborev High)
/// The request-awareness above covers ordinary HTTP exchanges, but this bound lives at the RAW IO layer,
/// BELOW hyper, so once a connection has UPGRADED to a long-lived bidirectional stream it can no longer
/// see an application-level "exchange" at all — the upgrade's originating HTTP request has completed, so
/// the in-flight count is back to 0. A **WebSocketChannel2023 receive socket**
/// ([`crate::notifications::ws`]) is **server→client only** and legitimately sits quiet — no inbound
/// bytes, and no outbound until the first notification fires — for as long as the client subscribes.
/// An idle bound that closed it would tear down a LIVE subscription. So this guard is **disabled by
/// default** ([`DEFAULT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS`] = 0) and is for operators who terminate no long-lived
/// upgraded/streaming connections on this listener (or front them elsewhere). The deadline also resets on
/// read OR write activity (so an actively-pushing connection survives even when the guard is on), but a
/// post-upgrade connection quiet in BOTH directions is still closed — which is exactly why the WS case
/// requires OFF.
///
/// ## The gap it closes (when an operator DOES enable it)
/// hyper exposes NO native idle-connection timeout (verified against hyper 1.x). The existing bounds do
/// NOT cover an idle keep-alive connection:
/// - `http1::Builder::header_read_timeout` bounds reading a COMPLETE header set once bytes START
///   arriving — it does not fire on a connection that has sent a full request, got its response, and now
///   holds the keep-alive connection open sending nothing;
/// - the h2 keep-alive PING reclaims a DEAD peer (one that stops acking), not a live peer holding an
///   idle connection.
///
/// ## The timer is reset on READ OR WRITE ACTIVITY (any progress) AND paused while a request is in flight
/// The `Sleep` deadline is reset whenever a `poll_read` OR a `poll_write`/`poll_write_vectored` makes
/// progress (returns `Ready`), AND held fresh (never fired) while an HTTP exchange is in flight (the
/// request-aware pause above). It fires ONLY after a full window with NO progress in EITHER direction AND
/// NO exchange in flight. So a slow-but-progressing reader/writer resets the deadline on each chunk, and a
/// stalled-but-in-flight request/response is paused, so this never kills a legitimately slow link; the
/// slowloris HEADER trickle is bounded separately by `header_read_timeout` (a complete-head deadline that
/// a per-byte reset cannot defeat).
///
/// ## HTTP/2 interaction
/// Under HTTP/2 the server's keep-alive PING (when configured) elicits a client PONG — a READ — and the
/// PING itself is a WRITE, so an h2 connection with the PING on is never seen as idle by this bound; the
/// PING/PONG liveness probe is the h2 dead-peer reclaim. So when both are enabled, set the idle window
/// LARGER than the PING interval so they do not race.

/// pass-through (the request count is not even tracked).
///
/// ## Per-connection counter (the load-bearing scoping)
/// The acceptor creates ONE `MaxRequestsService` per accepted connection (in `accept`), so its counter
/// is genuinely PER-CONNECTION. hyper CLONES the service per request to serve concurrent/pipelined
/// requests on the connection, so the counter is an `Arc<AtomicU64>` SHARED across those clones (the
/// `Clone` impl shares the `Arc`) — counting all requests on this one connection — but NOT shared with
/// any OTHER connection's service (each `accept` makes a fresh `Arc`). A `fetch_add` on each call gives
/// the request's 1-based ordinal; at/after the cap the response gets `Connection: close`.
///
/// ## Protocol-upgrade exemption (the WebSocketChannel2023 receive socket)
/// The `Connection: close` stamp is SKIPPED for a COMPLETED protocol-UPGRADE response — a `101 Switching
/// Protocols` (see `is_upgrade_response`). The WS receive-socket handshake (`GET …/receive`) is served
/// through this same guarded acceptor, so with a small cap the upgrade IS the cap-th (or a later)
/// request; stamping `Connection: close` on its 101 would strip the required `Connection: Upgrade` token
/// and the client would FAIL the handshake (RFC 6455 §4.1). The exemption is keyed on the `101` STATUS,
/// not the mere presence of an `Upgrade` header — a non-101 response that merely advertises `Upgrade`
/// (e.g. a `426 Upgrade Required`) is an ordinary keep-alive response the cap still closes, so it cannot
/// bypass the reuse cap. The cap therefore applies to every ordinary keep-alive response; it simply
/// never clobbers a real (101) upgrade.
///
/// ## Why a header, not `graceful_shutdown` (the correctness choice)
/// Setting `Connection: close` lets the IN-FLIGHT response complete cleanly and THEN closes the
/// connection — the HTTP-correct way to end keep-alive reuse. Calling hyper's per-connection
/// `graceful_shutdown` instead would be coarser (it tears the whole connection state down). The header
