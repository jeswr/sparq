//! Deterministic summaries of already-computed policy decisions.
//!
//! This module is read-only: it counts the result of [`crate::evaluate`] and never
//! evaluates, changes, or re-derives an authorization decision. Callers pair each
//! decision with its request action because [`crate::Decision`] intentionally stores
//! only the verdict and its audit evidence.
