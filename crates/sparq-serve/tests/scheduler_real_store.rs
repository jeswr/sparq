//! Scheduler over the PRODUCTION substrate: the [`Scheduler`] dispatching real
//! SPARQL queries that each pin a generation from the A1 [`GenerationRing`] and
//! run the real `sparq_engine` evaluator — while the sequenced [`Writer`]
//! publishes new generations concurrently.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] written while Fable 5 unavailable — re-review when Fable returns.
//!
//! This is the brief's CORRECTNESS gate at the full-stack level (category 4):
//! scheduling must not change RESULTS or snapshot semantics. Each scheduled job
//! pins `ring.current()` *inside the closure* (A1 snapshot consistency) and runs
//! the engine against it; we assert the scheduled result is byte-identical to
//! running the same query directly against the same pinned generation, including
//! while writes advance the ring underneath.
