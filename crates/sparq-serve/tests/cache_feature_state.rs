//! Feature-state coverage for the `result-cache` surface ([OPUS-4.8] sq-jluc).
//!
//! `result-cache` is OFF by default: when off, the whole cache + canonicalization
//! surface (`cache.rs`, `canon.rs`) is `cfg`'d out of the crate entirely, and the
//! default serving substrate (the generation ring + per-pod epoch vectors) must be
//! byte-identical to a build that never knew about a cache. The `result_cache.rs`
//! correctness sweep is `#![cfg(feature = "result-cache")]`, so before this file the
//! DEFAULT-OFF build had no test of its own.
//!
//! This file is deliberately NOT feature-gated: it compiles and runs in BOTH states.
//! It pins two things the bead calls out:
//!   1. the ring + epoch substrate (the cache's invalidation source) is correct
//!      with the cache off, and
//!   2. the cache surface is gated by the feature from BOTH cfg arms — the
//!      `cache_off` / `cache_on` modules below each compile under exactly one arm,
//!      so a build that turned the feature on accidentally (or off) would fail to
//!      compile here.
