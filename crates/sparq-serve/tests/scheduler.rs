//! Read-side query scheduler behaviour (research/concurrent-serving.md §6.2;
//! serve Wave B — goal #4 requirements 3 + 4). These are the **empirical-honesty**
//! tests the brief mandates (non-sycophantic — a measured "the scheduler is not
//! worth it for mix X" is a valid outcome and is reported as such):
//!
//! 1. NO-REGRESSION (degenerate): an all-cheap / all-disjoint workload must show
//!    no meaningful latency regression from the scheduler machinery vs running
//!    unscheduled. Measured, reported honestly.
//! 2. HEAD-OF-LINE: a flood of cheap jobs with ONE concurrent expensive job —
//!    cheap p50/p99 with vs without the expensive job; the win is bounded p99.
//!    Open-loop, coordinated-omission-safe arrival.
//! 3. STARVATION: the expensive job still completes (aging works) even under a
//!    sustained cheap flood — asserted, not assumed.
//! 4. CORRECTNESS: scheduling does not change RESULTS or snapshot semantics —
//!    differential vs unscheduled execution, byte-for-byte.
//!
//! Timing numbers printed here are MEASURED UNDER CONCURRENT LOAD (other heavy
//! agents share this machine) — they are sanity gates with wide margins, not
//! final throughput claims. The structural properties (ordering, no-starvation,
//! result equality) are load-independent and asserted hard.
