//! sparq-serve concurrent-serving-core micro-benchmark. [OPUS-4.8] sq-ncvq.12. Run:
//!     cargo run -p sparq-serve --example bench --release
//!
//! Measures the lock-free serving primitives that motivate the crate (the
//! generation ring replacing the double-buffered snapshot scheme, §4.3/§4.4):
//!   1. current() — the lock-free `ArcSwap::load` read every reader does on
//!      entry to pin a generation (the hot path; must be ~ns);
//!   2. publish() — one writer-side generation publish (arc-swap of a new
//!      immutable snapshot + per-pod epoch bump), the cost a reader NEVER pays;
//!   3. scheduler — `run` round-trip through the two-lane cost-aware pool for a
//!      cheap job and a heavy job (submit → worker → result).
//!
//! The snapshot type is a cheap `usize` so the numbers isolate the ring/scheduler
//! machinery, NOT graph-build cost (that is the engine's ingest benches). A
//! concurrent-reader arm reports aggregate current() throughput while a writer
//! publishes, exercising the readers-never-block-the-writer invariant.
//!
//! NON-CANONICAL timing (this box is not a quiet bench instance) — the numbers are
//! a sanity-scale signal, not a published baseline.
