//! Response-bytes result cache (research/concurrent-serving.md §5 verdict 2, §6.3).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-jluc — written while Fable 5 unavailable; re-review when Fable
//! returns. **OPT-IN, OFF by default** (cargo feature `result-cache`).
//!
//! This is the §5-row-2 **RECOMMEND**: a cache from a *request identity* to the
//! complete, pre-serialized response body the engine produced, so a repeated read
//! returns bytes in tens of nanoseconds instead of re-executing (the only route to
//! the Mreq/s envelope of §1). It sits **in front of** `prepare()`/engine dispatch
//! and is a strictly different layer from `sparq-engine`'s `cache.rs` (the embedded
//! whole-query algebra-keyed LRU that lives inside one engine instance); this cache
//! is keyed on *visibility scope* and invalidated by the serving writer's per-pod
//! epoch bumps, neither of which the engine layer knows about.
//!
//! # The key: `(canonical-query, visibility-scope, epoch-vector)` — §6.3
//!
//! - **Canonical-query** ([`canonicalize`](crate::canonicalize)): cheap whitespace (and opt-in
//!   variable) normalization, hashed. So `SELECT ?x WHERE{…}` and the same query
//!   reindented share an entry.
//! - **Visibility-scope** ([`ScopeKey`]): the identity of the *accessible graph
//!   set* a request runs under — `sparq_solid::AuthIndex::accessible(session,
//!   mode)`'s sorted set, hashed. **This is a correctness / access-control
//!   obligation, not a privacy guarantee** (stated honestly below): two sessions
//!   that can see different graph sets get different keys, so cached bytes computed
//!   for one access scope can **never** be served to a different one. We key on the
//!   *scope* (the Hasura minimal-footprint lesson), **never** on the WebID/identity
//!   — many WebIDs share one public-read scope, which is exactly the high-tenancy
//!   key-fragmentation mitigation §6.3 calls for.
//! - **Epoch-vector**: not part of the *lookup* key (that would mint a fresh,
//!   never-reused slot on every write); instead each entry **records** the per-pod
//!   epoch of the graphs its query touched. On read the recorded epochs are checked
//!   against the live generation's [`PodEpochs`](crate::PodEpochs); any advance is a
//!   stale miss and evicts the entry. A query whose footprint is *unbounded* (it
//!   could read graphs we cannot statically enumerate) records the **global
//!   generation** number and is invalidated by ANY write — the conservative,
//!   answer-safe choice.
//!
//! ## Why scope keying is correctness, not privacy (honest boundary)
//!
//! Keying on `accessible` guarantees the cache never *introduces* a cross-scope
//! leak the engine wouldn't already prevent: the bytes stored under a scope were
//! produced by the engine evaluating *under that scope's `DatasetView`*, so they
//! contain only what that scope may see, and they are only ever returned to a
//! request that presents the same scope key. It is an **invariant of this cache**
//! (tested: a different scope MUST miss), enforcing the access-control boundary the
//! auth layer already defines. It is **not** itself a confidentiality mechanism
//! (it makes no cryptographic claim, hides nothing from a side channel, and trusts
//! the caller to derive the scope key faithfully from a *correctly evaluated*
//! `accessible` set — a wrong scope key would be an auth-layer bug, not a cache
//! bug). See the privacy-claims discipline in `AGENTS.md`.
//!
//! # Single-flight / lease dedup (§5 verdict 1, the one MQO survivor)
//!
//! On a miss the first caller takes a **lease** for the key; concurrent callers for
//! the same key **wait** on that lease rather than each re-executing (a stampede
//! becomes one execution, N waiters). [`ResultCache::lease`] returns either
//! [`LeaseOutcome::Hit`] (bytes already cached and fresh), [`LeaseOutcome::Lead`] (you
//! execute, then [`LeadGuard::fulfill`] publishes the bytes and wakes waiters), or
//! [`LeaseOutcome::Wait`] (block on [`WaitGuard::wait`] for the leader's bytes).
//!
//! # Bounds: byte-budget LRU + admission (§6.3)
//!
//! The cache holds at most `max_bytes` of response bodies; inserting evicts
//! least-recently-used entries until it fits. A body larger than
//! `max_entry_bytes` is **never admitted** (oversize/streaming results are not
//! cacheable — they would evict everything else for one entry). Admission returns
//! the bytes to the caller regardless; rejection only means "don't keep it".
//!
//! # Library-first (§6.1)
//!
//! Sync, runtime-agnostic, no HTTP/async types. The cache stores opaque
//! [`Bytes`](std::sync::Arc) blobs and `&str` formats; it never parses a query
//! (only canonicalizes the text) and never touches `sparq-solid` — the caller
//! derives the [`ScopeKey`] and the touched-pod footprint and hands them in.
