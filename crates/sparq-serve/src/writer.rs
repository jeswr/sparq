//! The single sequenced writer with a group-commit window
//! (research/concurrent-serving.md §6.5) — Wave A deliverable 2, composing over
//! the A1 [`GenerationRing`].
//!
//! One writer thread owns the sole right to publish generations. Callers submit
//! updates (an opaque `Update` value plus the set of touched [`PodId`]s — for
//! prod-solid-server shapes statically the resource graph + parent graph, §6.5);
//! the writer batches every update that arrives within a **group-commit window**
//! (`min(T_window, N_max)`, default 3 ms / 256 updates) into ONE new snapshot and
//! publishes it as ONE generation, bumping the epochs of the union of the touched
//! pods. Readers are never involved: they keep loading
//! [`GenerationRing::current`] lock-free; the only writer/reader interaction is
//! the ring's arc-swap at publish.
//!
//! ## Adaptive group-commit ([`WriterConfig::adaptive_commit`])
//!
//! The fixed window is a batching heuristic, not a correctness requirement, and it
//! is pure latency for a **serial / low-concurrency** client that blocks on its own
//! ack (the interactive LDP-CRUD shape): nothing else can arrive to fill the window,
//! so each update pays ~`window` even though the engine's `update_in_place` is ~15 µs
//! (the sq-p7kk5 update-path gap — the 3 ms default window dominated a serial
//! client's ~99% of commit latency). Opt-in [`adaptive_commit`](WriterConfig::adaptive_commit)
//! drops the timed wait: after the first update the writer drains only the ALREADY-
//! queued backlog (`try_recv`) and commits the instant it empties. Serial clients
//! commit in engine-time; a genuinely concurrent stream still batches whatever piled
//! up between iterations, so group-commit amortisation under load is preserved. FIFO
//! order, per-update atomicity, and every ACID property below are unchanged — only
//! epoch-tick granularity may be finer (a Wave-B cache-key concern, never
//! correctness). sparq-server enables it for its write path.
//!
//! ## Sequencing and ACID (§6.5)
//!
//! Updates inside a batch are applied in **submission order** (strict FIFO — the
//! deterministic, replayable single-order log that replication will lean on;
//! commutativity is used as a *grouping license*, never to reorder). Cross-batch
//! reordering: none — batches are committed in sequence by the one thread.
//! A = per-update atomicity via the failed-update policy below; C = single-order
//! application; I = snapshot isolation for readers + the serial writer;
//! D = out of scope for the in-memory server v1 (as §6.5 records).
//!
//! ## Commutativity batching ([`CommitGranularity`])
//!
//! With the default [`CommitGranularity::Window`], one window = one generation =
//! one epoch tick — litreview A's epoch group-commit pattern ("one new
//! generation per epoch, not per statement"), and the §3.3/§6.5 prescription
//! that generation granularity come from batching windows. Correctness never
//! needs more: FIFO application of the whole window onto one working copy *is*
//! the serial order.
//!
//! Opt-in [`CommitGranularity::CommuteGroup`] splits each window's batch into
//! maximal runs of provably-commuting pure-data updates
//! ([`Footprint::commutes_with`] — conservative graph-level detection; an
//! unanalyzable update or a same-graph opposite-polarity data update is a
//! barrier) and publishes ONE generation per run, in arrival order. Every
//! published generation is then internally conflict-free — a log record whose
//! updates can be replayed or applied in any order (the parallel-delta /
//! replication seam of §6.8) — and each epoch tick covers exactly one commuting
//! group. The price is one fork/seal/publish per run instead of per window
//! (barrier-heavy streams degrade to per-update generations) plus one
//! footprint parse per update on the writer thread; `bench/serve/writer_spike`
//! measures both. Application order is FIFO in both modes, so the committed
//! result is byte-identical to serial execution either way (differential-tested
//! in `tests/commute.rs`).
//!
//! ## Failed-update policy (documented contract)
//!
//! A failing update must not poison its batch: updates are applied in submission
//! order against a writer-private working copy; an update that fails to apply is
//! **reported to its submitter and skipped — every other update in the batch
//! proceeds**. Rationale: batch membership is an artifact of arrival timing, not
//! of intent — two independent clients whose requests happen to share a 3 ms
//! window must not see each other's failures (atomicity stays per update, exactly
//! as today's `AppState::apply_update` provides). The epochs bumped at publish
//! are the union of the touched pods of the *successful* updates only — a skipped
//! update changed nothing, so bumping its pods would churn Wave B cache keys
//! spuriously. If every update in a batch fails, **no generation is published**
//! (an identical snapshot under a new number would invalidate nothing and help
//! nobody).
//!
//! Recovery detail: a failed [`ApplyUpdates::apply`] may have left the working
//! copy partially mutated (the engine's `update_in_place` documents exactly this
//! prefix-application hazard, and the existing server Writer discards its buffer
//! for the same reason). The writer therefore conservatively discards the working
//! copy, re-forks the base snapshot, and replays the batch's previously-successful
//! updates in order before continuing — one extra O(fork) per failed update,
//! acceptable because failures are the rare path (parse errors and constraint
//! violations, not steady state).
//!
//! ## Snapshot production (the §6.4 "working copy")
//!
//! §6.4 imagines a persistent writer-private working copy folded periodically.
//! That scheme worked for the double buffer because the writer could *reclaim*
//! the previously published graph (`Arc::try_unwrap` + poll) — which is both the
//! measured pathology A1 removed (5.4 s/32 s pinned-snapshot stall, §4.3/§4.4)
//! and *impossible* under the ring by design: the ring itself retains up to K
//! old generations, so a published graph never drains back to the writer.
//! Every publish therefore mints a fresh `Graph` — via the STRUCTURAL FORK
//! (`Graph::fork`): the immutable storage (indexes, dict base, caches) is
//! Arc-shared with the base generation and only the small pending delta is
//! copied, so fork is O(delta) and the periodic fold §6.4 wanted lives in
//! [`ApplyUpdates::seal`] as a threshold compaction — see
//! [`GraphApplier`](crate::GraphApplier) for the policy and measured numbers.
