//! Per-pod epoch vectors (research/concurrent-serving.md §6.3, §6.5).
//!
//! Each [`Generation`](crate::Generation) carries a map pod-id → epoch. Publishing
//! a generation that touched pods P bumps exactly those pods' epochs. This is the
//! cache-invalidation hook for Wave B: a cached entry records the epochs of the
//! pods its query touched, and stays valid while those epochs are unchanged — so
//! unrelated writes (other pods) never churn cache keys. Pods are named graphs
//! (§6.5: "pod/named-graph granularity is the natural and honest conflict unit"),
//! and per-pod epochs are also load-bearing for horizontal scaling (§6.8: pods are
//! the shard key; the epoch vector partitions cleanly).
//!
//! Only the data structure and bump logic live here — no cache (Wave B).
