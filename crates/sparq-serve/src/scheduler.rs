//! The read-side query scheduler (research/concurrent-serving.md §6.2; the wave
//! plan's Wave C, scoped here as the "serve Wave B" deliverable — goal #4
//! requirements 3 + 4: **cheap-query prioritisation** and **no head-of-line
//! blocking**). It composes over the A1 [`GenerationRing`](crate::GenerationRing):
//! a reader still pins a generation on entry (snapshot consistency, §6.4); the
//! scheduler only decides *when and on which worker* the pinned read runs.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] written while Fable 5 unavailable — re-review when Fable returns.
//!
//! ## Design (Umbra-style, litreview-C Topic A)
//!
//! The reference is Umbra's self-tuning scheduler (Wagner et al., SIGMOD 2021):
//! priority decay approximates SRPT while a floor (`p_min > 0`) guarantees long
//! queries a background share so they never starve; new arrivals enter at
//! `p₀ ≫ decayed priorities` so they immediately dominate instead of queueing
//! behind heavies. Schrage (1968): SRPT minimises mean response time. Wierman &
//! Nuyens (SIGMETRICS 2008): SRPT-like policies tolerate crude size estimates with
//! bounded degradation — so a *cheap* cost estimate suffices (§2.3), and this
//! crate stays decoupled from any particular estimator.
//!
//! sparq's engine has **no re-entrant suspend/resume** (§3.2: the only checkpoint
//! is `QueryBudget`'s cooperative abort), so true preemption is out of scope. What
//! delivers the two required properties without it:
//!
//! 1. **Two lanes by a cheap cost estimate.** A job whose estimate is below
//!    [`SchedulerConfig::heavy_threshold`] is *cheap*; otherwise *heavy*. Cheap
//!    jobs are picked strictly before heavy jobs and within their lane run FIFO
//!    (they are uniform-ish and tiny — SRPT ordering among them is pure overhead).
//! 2. **Reserved cheap capacity = no head-of-line blocking.** The heavy lane runs
//!    on at most [`SchedulerConfig::heavy_concurrency`] workers (default
//!    `cores/2`, never more than `workers − 1`). So however many expensive
//!    queries flood in, at least `workers − heavy_concurrency ≥ 1` workers are
//!    always free to pick a cheap job the instant it arrives — a big scan can
//!    never monopolise the pool. This is the §4.5-B fix (expensive queries
//!    bounded so they cannot saturate the box) made structural.
//! 3. **SRPT-approx + aging *within* the heavy lane.** Heavy jobs are ordered by a
//!    decaying priority: each job starts at [`P0`](crate::P0); while it waits, an
//!    aging credit lifts effective priority, and a higher *estimated cost* lowers
//!    it (shortest-estimated-first ≈ SRPT). The aging term is unbounded in wait
//!    time, so the most-postponed heavy job always eventually becomes the
//!    max-priority pick — **starvation-free by construction** (the `p_min`/MLFQ
//!    boost role, litreview-C line 37). Proven in `tests/scheduler.rs`
//!    (`heavy_query_not_starved_under_cheap_flood`).
//!
//! ## What the scheduler does NOT change (correctness, §5 verdict 3 scope)
//!
//! The work itself is a caller-supplied closure run **verbatim** (the closure
//! pins its generation and runs the engine). Scheduling reorders *when* closures
//! run and *on which thread* — never *what* they compute. Results and snapshot
//! semantics are therefore identical to unscheduled execution; `tests/scheduler.rs`
//! differentially asserts byte-identical results vs direct execution.
//!
//! ## Library-first (§6.1)
//!
//! Sync, runtime-agnostic. The scheduler owns `std::thread` workers and
//! `std::sync` primitives only — no HTTP, no async-runtime types.
//! [`Scheduler::submit`] is callable from any thread and returns immediately with
//! a [`Ticket`]; blocking for the result on the caller's own thread is
//! [`Ticket::wait`]. A future that resolves on the ticket (a `submit_async`
//! adapter) belongs behind the crate's later `tokio` feature, not here. The
//! estimator and the work are both injected, so the scheduler never
//! reaches into `sparq-engine`/`sparq-core` itself — it stays a pure
//! cost-aware bounded thread pool.
