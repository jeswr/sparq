//! Adaptive re-planning (design §4.5, the deferred ANAPSID half) — **Phase 7**, the FINAL
//! phase of the streaming federation client (epic **sq-dnko**).
//!
//! Phases 3 + 5 execute the **static** [`JoinTree`](sparq_fedplan::JoinTree) that
//! [`sparq-fedplan`](sparq_fedplan) commits to up front, from descriptor-derived **estimates**.
//! When those descriptors are accurate the static plan is simplest and at least as good
//! (design §7), so it remains the default. But in a real federation the estimates are often
//! wrong: a source returns far more (or fewer) bindings than its VoID statistics predicted.
//! This module is the opt-in feedback loop that *reacts* to that — ANAPSID's harder half:
//!
//! > As streaming execution proceeds, each completed operator reports its **observed**
//! > leaf cardinality. When that diverges materially from the estimate the static plan was
//! > built on, the client re-invokes [`sparq-fedplan`](sparq_fedplan)'s planner on the
//! > **unjoined remainder** (never the already-joined prefix) to choose a cheaper suffix
//! > plan — bounded to **at most once per operator boundary** so it never thrashes.
//!
//! # Where the planner-level engine lives (and what this module adds)
//!
//! The *re-plan decision* — the divergence trigger, the hysteresis / anti-thrash margin, the
//! suffix re-ordering, and the commutativity correctness proof — is already implemented, tested, and gated in
//! `sparq-fedplan`'s [`AdaptiveExecutor`](sparq_fedplan::AdaptiveExecutor) /
//! [`RuntimeStats`](sparq_fedplan::RuntimeStats) / [`ReplanPolicy`](sparq_fedplan::ReplanPolicy)
//! (bead `sq-7s4z`, behind its `adaptive-replan` feature). The client does **not** re-write
//! that engine, exactly as it does not re-write the static planner.
//!
//! What Phase 7 adds is the **client-side execution loop** that engine drives: it runs the
//! plan as a sequence of stages, **fetches** each leaf through the real
//! [`FederatedSource`](crate::FederatedSource) adapter, feeds the *real observed row count*
//! back into [`RuntimeStats`](sparq_fedplan::RuntimeStats), asks the executor whether to
//! re-plan the remaining stages, and
//! joins the (possibly re-ordered) suffix with the **same** materialised
//! [`natural_join`](crate::operators) the static interpreter uses. The observed cardinality is
//! genuine — you cannot know a leaf's true cardinality until you have drained it, which is
//! exactly the operator-boundary point ANAPSID re-plans at.
//!
//! # The load-bearing correctness property (result-equivalence)
//!
//! > Re-planning changes the **plan**, never the **answer**. For any divergence, the adaptive
//! > execution produces the **same solution multiset** as the static
//! > [`JoinTree`](sparq_fedplan::JoinTree).
//!
//! This holds because a BGP's answer is the natural join of its per-pattern solution
//! multisets, which is **commutative and associative** (proven exhaustively in
//! `sparq-fedplan`'s `evaluate_is_order_independent_all_permutations`): any join order over
//! the same pattern set yields the same multiset. A re-plan only reorders the not-yet-executed
//! suffix — it never adds, drops, or alters a pattern — and the already-joined prefix is
//! carried across the switch unchanged, so no binding is lost or duplicated. The crate test
//! `replan_result_equals_static_under_divergence` asserts this across a *genuine* large-
//! divergence switch (the suffix order really flips), and `replan_fires_at_most_once_per_boundary`
//! asserts the once-per-boundary bound.
//!
//! # Honest scope (work-vs-stub split)
//!
//! REAL here: the leaf-scan-then-adaptive-join executor, the observed-cardinality capture from
//! the real adapter, the [`RuntimeStats`](sparq_fedplan::RuntimeStats) /
//! [`AdaptiveExecutor`](sparq_fedplan::AdaptiveExecutor) wiring, the
//! at-most-once-per-boundary bound, and the correctness tests on the real interpreter path
//! (the in-crate canned-SRJ tests below, plus the end-to-end
//! `tests/adaptive_result_equals_static.rs` against the REAL engine). Two entry points share
//! the loop ([FABLE-5] sq-xw8zz): [`execute_adaptive_single_source`] keeps the Phase-3/5
//! [`InterpError::MultiSource`](crate::operators::InterpError) guard (one explicit adapter for
//! every leaf), and [`execute_adaptive_multi_source`] lifts it — a leaf the planner retained
//! several sources for is answered as the **bag-union of per-arm fetches** (the `sq-7yf0`
//! union semantics), with each arm's wall-clock latency recorded per source index into
//! [`RuntimeStats`](sparq_fedplan::RuntimeStats), so the re-plan cost model's latency factor
//! (slowest-arm by default,
//! [`LatencyAggregation::CardinalityWeighted`](sparq_fedplan::LatencyAggregation) opt-in,
//! `sq-s5kd`) runs on LIVE per-arm observations rather than only planner-level/test-injected
//! ones. Each
//! per-stage join is the materialised [`natural_join`](crate::operators).
//!
//! By its nature the observed-cardinality boundary is a **materialisation point** — a leaf must
//! be drained to be counted — so the adaptive path scans each leaf fully (once) to learn its
//! real cardinality, then re-orders the join. That trades the within-stage streaming of Phase 5
//! for the cross-stage *re-ordering* this phase buys. Folding the two together — stream a stage
//! WHILE estimating its cardinality from a *prefix* of its rows, the ANAPSID "adaptive operator"
//! refinement — is a clear next slice, filed as a roadmap bead under epic sq-3183, not
//! half-built here.
//
// [OPUS-4.8] sq-ij5x (epic sq-dnko, FINAL phase): client-side adaptive re-planning. Wires
// sparq-fedplan's AdaptiveExecutor into the real federated execution loop. Flagged for Fable
// re-review when available.
// [FABLE-5] sq-xw8zz: multi-source (union-arm) adaptive execution loop — lifts the
// MultiSource guard behind `execute_adaptive_multi_source` and feeds LIVE per-arm latencies
// into RuntimeStats (makes the sq-s5kd CardinalityWeighted aggregation live-consumable).
