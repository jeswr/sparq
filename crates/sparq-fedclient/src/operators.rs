//! Physical federation operators (design §4.4) — **Phase 3 (materialised single-source
//! interpreter)**.
//!
//! This module walks a [`JoinTree`](sparq_fedplan::JoinTree) and *interprets* it: for each
//! leaf it lowers the pattern to a [`SubQuery`](crate::source::SubQuery)
//! ([`crate::planner::lower_leaf`]), runs it through the Phase-2
//! [`FederatedSource`](crate::FederatedSource) adapter (`execute` → an SRJ body), parses
//! that body into a [`Relation`], and joins the leaf relations **in the plan's join order**
//! with a materialised left-deep hash join. The output is a [`Relation`] — the federated
//! answer.
//!
//! # The load-bearing correctness property
//!
//! The Phase-3 deliverable is the **result-equivalence invariant**, tested against the real
//! engine:
//!
//! > For a single source holding a graph `G`, materialising a `sparq-fedplan` plan of a BGP
//! > `Q` through this interpreter yields **the same solution multiset** as evaluating `Q`
//! > locally with `sparq-engine` over `G`.
//!
//! [`solutions_equal`] is the multiset comparison (order-independent, bag semantics) and
//! the integration test `planner_result_equals_local_eval.rs` drives it end-to-end: it
//! loads a graph into a `sparq-core::Graph`, serves each leaf sub-query from that graph via
//! a [`FederatedSource`] whose transport answers from the **local engine** (so the
//! "remote" SRJ is exactly what a conformant endpoint over `G` would return), runs this
//! interpreter, and asserts [`solutions_equal`] against `sparq_engine::query(&G, Q)`.
//! That closes the loop the bead asks for: the materialised result EQUALS local eval.
//!
//! # Honest work-vs-stub split (Phase 3)
//!
//! REAL here: the SRJ parser, the index-resolved leaf lowering, the materialised left-deep
//! join, the projection over the BGP's variables, and the result-equivalence test against
//! the engine. The join is a **blocking** materialised hash join — every leaf relation is
//! fetched and held in full before joining. STUBBED for Phase 5: the non-blocking
//! `StreamJoin` feeder, concurrent leaf fan-out, the per-block bind-join operator, and
//! multi-source UNION-per-leaf (this interpreter answers a plan whose every leaf resolves
//! to ONE source; a leaf with two retained sources is rejected with
//! [`InterpError::MultiSource`] rather than silently dropping a source). The interpreter
//! also requires the plan's join algorithm to be a hash-class step — it does not yet
//! special-case [`JoinAlgo::Bind`](sparq_fedplan::JoinAlgo::Bind); a bind join is executed
//! with the same materialised hash join (semantically identical result, just not the
//! pushed-down execution discipline), which is sound for the equivalence property.
//
// [OPUS-4.8] sq-j27p (epic sq-dnko): Phase-3 materialised single-source interpreter +
// SRJ parser + result-equivalence invariant. Flagged for Fable re-review when available.
