//! Capability-aware pushdown (design §4.3) — **Phase 4**.
//!
//! `sparq-fedplan` decides *which* sources answer *which* patterns and in *what* join
//! order; it does **not** decide the precise sub-query each source is asked. That is this
//! module's job: for each **FedX-style exclusive group** — a connected sub-pattern whose
//! only relevant source is one member — build the **maximal evaluable sub-algebra** for that
//! source's [`Capability`](crate::source::Capability) and emit it as one
//! [`SubQuery`](crate::source::SubQuery), so the source answers the most precise query it
//! can rather than one single-pattern `SELECT` per leaf (the Phase-3 `lower_leaf` shape).
//!
//! # What Phase 4 ships (HONEST scope)
//!
//! * [`exclusive_groups`] — the **exclusive-group decomposition**. From the planner's
//!   per-pattern source selection ([`PatternSources`](sparq_fedplan::PatternSources)) it
//!   forms the maximal sets of patterns that (a) each have **exactly one** retained source,
//!   (b) the **same** source, and (c) are **connected** by a shared variable (transitively).
//!   These are exactly the sub-BGPs FedX pushes as one sub-query. A pattern matched by two
//!   or more sources is **not** in any exclusive group — it is a cross-source join the
//!   operators phase fans out (kept out of pushdown, never under-answered).
//! * [`push_group`] — the **maximal sub-algebra builder**. For one exclusive group it builds
//!   the most precise [`SubQuery`] the group's source can answer: the projection trimmed to
//!   exactly the **join + output** variables (everything else is internal to the group), the
//!   FILTER conjuncts the source's [`FilterClass`](crate::source::FilterClass) covers AND
//!   that pass the **exact common-variable check** (below), and `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT` only
//!   when the capability's `order_limit` allows. The shape is chosen by interface:
//!   - **full endpoint** → a multi-pattern `SELECT … WHERE { tp … FILTER(…) } ORDER/LIMIT`;
//!   - **brTPF / plain TPF** → a single triple pattern only (a fragment server's access unit
//!     is one pattern); a group of >1 pattern on a fragment source is *not* collapsed into
//!     one sub-query — pushdown emits one per pattern and the join stays client-side.
//! * [`common_variable_check`] — the **exact** check Comunica is documented to omit
//!   (issues #834/#609): a FILTER conjunct is pushed **only when every variable it
//!   references is bound by the group's patterns**. A conjunct over a variable the group
//!   does not produce would change the remote answer (the remote sees an *unbound* variable
//!   where local evaluation sees it bound by a sibling group), so it is kept local. This is
//!   the load-bearing safety invariant: push only the provably-identical sub-algebra.
//! * [`render_values_block`] / [`bind_block_size`] — the **bind-join block** primitive used
//!   to join *across* groups: a `VALUES` block for a full endpoint (block size
//!   [`DEFAULT_BIND_BLOCK`]), a `maxMpR`-bounded block for brTPF, no block for plain TPF.
//!   This mirrors `sparq-engine`'s `service.rs::render_values_block` / `bind_block_size`
//!   (`pub(crate)`, so re-declared here exactly as Phase 2 re-declares the `Transport` seam).
//!
//! # Correctness — pushdown only ever NARROWS
//!
//! Every transform here either removes solutions a source would have returned (a pushed
//! FILTER) or removes columns the caller does not need (a trimmed projection) or bounds the
//! rows requested (`VALUES`/`maxMpR`) — it never adds an answer the residual local join
//! would not reattach. The common-variable check is what makes that true for filters: a
//! conjunct whose variables are all group-bound evaluates identically remote-side and
//! local-side, so pushing it cannot drop a solution the local plan would keep. Anything a
//! source cannot evaluate (a filter that fails the class check or the common-variable check,
//! a cross-source pattern, an `ORDER`/`LIMIT` the capability omits) is left for the local
//! engine on the residual — pushdown is correctness-preserving by construction.
//!
//! # What is STUBBED / deferred (no overclaim)
//!
//! * The FILTER conjuncts are a **light, pre-parsed model** ([`Filter`]) — variable set +
//!   a rendered SPARQL fragment + the class it needs. Wiring the *real* parsed-query FILTER
//!   algebra (from `spargebra`) into this model, and the disjunctive/combined-filter
//!   decomposition the design §4.3 names, is Phase 5's job when the operators consume a whole
//!   query rather than a bare BGP. Phase 4 ships the per-conjunct pushability decision (class
//!   check + common-variable check) the operators call, tested on the model directly.
//! * The bind-join block here is the **rendered block + the size policy**; the operator that
//!   *gathers* upstream bindings, slices them into blocks, and streams the per-block matches
//!   is the Phase-5 `operators`/`stream` work. Phase 4 owns the block construction the
//!   operator emits, not the streaming feeder.
//! * `ORDER BY` is pushed as a passthrough of caller-supplied sort keys; the client does not
//!   yet parse a query's `ORDER BY` into keys (Phase 5) — `push_group` takes the keys as an
//!   argument so the lowering is testable now.
//
// [OPUS-4.8] sq-7byx (epic sq-dnko): Phase-4 capability-aware pushdown — exclusive-group
// decomposition + maximal sub-algebra builder + the exact common-variable check + the
// bind-join block primitive. Phase 4 owns this module; Phase 5 owns operators.rs/stream.rs.
