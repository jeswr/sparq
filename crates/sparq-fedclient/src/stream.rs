//! The `SolutionStream` boundary (design §4.4, §7) — **Phase 5**.
//!
//! `SolutionStream` is the async/iterator abstraction the client owns **at its boundary**.
//! It carries federated solutions ([`Solution`]) as they become derivable — adapters
//! produce it, the [`crate::operators`] streaming operators consume and produce it — so a
//! result can be handed to the caller **before** every input source has been exhausted.
//!
//! # The honest limit (design §7)
//!
//! `sparq-engine` stays **materialised**: it returns a fully-materialised `QueryResult` and
//! evaluates operators blocking. The client does NOT re-architect the engine into a global
//! async stream; it streams at *its own* boundary (adapter outputs + federation operators),
//! and a *local* sub-BGP evaluation through the engine remains a single materialised call.
//! End-to-end solution-level laziness *through* the engine is out of scope.
//!
//! # Why a channel and not an async runtime (design §7, the ASYNC/RUNTIME decision)
//!
//! The remote transport ([`crate::source::Transport::fetch`]) is **blocking**. Phase 5 does
//! NOT pull an async runtime (tokio / async-std) into the dependency tree — that would push
//! a heavy, viral dependency onto an opt-in crate and violate the lean-core constraint. All
//! concurrency stays *inside* this crate, built on `std` only: a producer side runs on a
//! **bounded blocking thread-pool** ([`crate::operators::ScatterPool`]) over the blocking
//! transport, and hands solutions across a **bounded** [`std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel`].
//! The channel's bound IS the backpressure: when the consumer is slower than the producers,
//! a `send` blocks the producer thread until the consumer drains, so a fast source cannot
//! grow an unbounded in-flight buffer. No GC heap, no runtime — just Rust ownership + the
//! channel bound + the reused [`StreamJoin`](sparq_fedplan::StreamJoin) spill.
//!
//! # Backpressure + bounded memory
//!
//! `SolutionStream` is a blocking `Iterator<Item = Result<Solution, FedError>>`. Pulling an
//! item dequeues one solution (or blocks until one is ready / the producers finish). Because
//! the channel is bounded, the resident in-flight set is capped at the channel capacity plus
//! whatever the streaming join operator holds (itself bounded by the `StreamJoin` spill).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-vtba (epic sq-dnko): Phase-5 streaming boundary. Flagged for Fable
//! re-review when available.
