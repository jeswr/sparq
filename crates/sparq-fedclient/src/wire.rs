//! brTPF binding-block **transport encodings** — a COMPACT BINARY mapping wire alongside
//! the line-oriented TEXT wire (bead `sq-6ihg`, follow-up to the server's `sq-dxhb` brTPF).
//!
//! # Why a second wire
//!
//! The brTPF bind-join attaches a SET of upstream solution mappings to each fragment request
//! (the [`source::FragBinding`](crate::source::FragBinding) block — at most `maxMpR` mappings,
//! the standardised bind-join of Hartig & Buil-Aranda, ODBASE 2016). The sparq **server**
//! (`sparq-server`, bead `sq-dxhb`) parses that set from a **line-oriented text wire**: one
//! mapping per line, whitespace-separated `position=term` pairs, where `term` is a fully
//! N-Triples-decorated term (`<iri>` / `"lit"` / `"lit"@en` / `"lit"^^<dt>`). That text wire is
//! human-readable and easy to put in a `GET ?values=` query string, but it is **verbose**: it
//! repeats the `s=` / `p=` / `o=` position key and the N-Triples framing (`<…>`, `"…"`,
//! `^^<…>`) on every single term, which inflates the brTPF payload — exactly the payload a
//! large bind-join block makes hot (`maxMpR` can be in the hundreds, and the block is re-sent on
//! every fragment request of a bind nested-loop join).
//!
//! `sq-6ihg` adds the alternative the bead asks for: a **compact, self-describing BINARY
//! mapping transport** ([`encode_bindings`] / [`decode_bindings`]) the client can produce
//! instead of the text wire, plus the text-wire writer ([`encode_bindings_text`]) so the client
//! can speak EITHER form over the same `FragBinding` model (the server already parses the text
//! form). The binary form drops the per-pair position key (a length-prefixed name instead of a
//! repeated `s=`/`p=`/`o=`) and the N-Triples framing (a one-byte **kind tag** distinguishes
//! IRI / blank node / literal, so the bare lexical bytes travel without `<>` / `""` decoration),
//! and length-prefixes every payload so it round-trips losslessly with no escaping.
//!
//! # Honest scope (no overclaim)
//!
//! This module is a **codec only** — it converts a `&[FragBinding]` to/from bytes (binary) and
//! to a `String` (text). It does NOT issue any request: the native HTTP
//! [`FragmentTransport`](crate::source::FragmentTransport) (`HttpFragmentTransport`, bead
//! `sq-yzca`) attaches the **text** form on the `values` query parameter (the carrier the sparq
//! server reads); this binary wire is the compact alternative a body-carrying transport emits.
//! What is load-bearing and tested here is
//! that the binary form is **lossless** (`decode_bindings(encode_bindings(b)) == b` for every
//! binding set, including literals with embedded `=`, whitespace, and newlines that the text
//! wire could not carry on a single line) and that the **text form matches the server's parser
//! grammar** (the same `position=term` grammar the server's `parse_bindings` reads), so a
//! client emitting either wire is understood by the existing server.
//!
//! The binary container carries a 4-byte magic + a 1-byte format version so a future wire
//! revision is detectable rather than silently misparsed, and [`decode_bindings`] validates
//! every length against the remaining input so a truncated / malformed buffer is a clean
//! [`WireError`], never a panic or an out-of-bounds read (this crate is `forbid(unsafe_code)`).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-6ihg — Fable re-review when available.
