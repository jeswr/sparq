    doc = r#"sparq-fedclient: a **streaming federation CLIENT** over heterogeneous remote RDF
sources — the query *consumer* half of federation (epic **sq-dnko** / **sq-3183**,
Phase 0 bead **sq-s1uy**). See `research/federation-client-design.md` — the crate's
architecture-of-record (§4 architecture, §7 honest risks).

Given one SPARQL query and a set of heterogeneous remote sources — full SPARQL
endpoints, bindings-restricted (brTPF) servers, plain TPF servers, and the *local*
sparq engine — this crate (when complete) **discovers** each source's capability,
**plans** a federated execution that pushes the most precise sub-query each source
can answer (REUSING the [`sparq-fedplan`](sparq_fedplan) cost-based planner), and
**streams** results back through non-blocking federation operators.

# What has landed, and what is still ahead

The crate began as the **Phase-0 compiling skeleton** (design §6) — the public module
layout the design §4 names ([`source`], [`discovery`], [`planner`], [`pushdown`],
[`operators`], [`stream`]), the **opt-in feature** ([`fedclient`](#opt-in-hard-constraint),
OFF by default), and the **dependency-boundary proof** (below). Landed since, each behind
the same default-OFF `fedclient` feature (with live pattern probing behind the additional
default-OFF `pattern_probe` feature):

* **Phase 1 — capability discovery** ([`discovery`], bead `sq-nfxl`): GET the source's
  Service Description + `/.well-known/void`, parse them to a `Capability` +
  `SourceDescriptor`, with a FedX-style ASK-probe fallback, all behind a default-deny
  SSRF-guarded fetch seam. The extra default-OFF `pattern_probe` feature (bead `sq-fx5id`)
  adds bounded, per-query pattern ASK/capped-SELECT observations through that same fetch seam;
  only definitive ASK `false` prunes, while every failure keeps the source.
* **Phase 2 — source-type abstraction + Endpoint adapter** ([`source`], bead `sq-rsxf`):
  [`SourceType`] (`Endpoint | BrTpf | Tpf | Local`), the [`FederatedSource`] trait, the
  fine-grained [`Capability`](source::Capability) descriptor, and the real [`Endpoint`] SRJ
  adapter over a [`Transport`] seam behind a default-deny [`EgressGuard`].
* **Phase 3 — planner bridge + materialised single-source interpreter** ([`planner`] +
  [`operators`], bead `sq-j27p`): [`SourceResolver`] index→adapter resolution + [`lower_leaf`],
  and [`materialize_single_source`] + [`parse_srj`] + [`solutions_equal`].
* **Phase 4 — capability-aware pushdown** ([`pushdown`], bead `sq-7byx`): per leaf / FedX
  exclusive group, build the most precise sub-query a source can answer (projection +
  common-variable-checked filters + ORDER/LIMIT under capability) — [`exclusive_groups`] +
  [`push_group`] + [`render_values_block`], correctness-preservingly NARROWing each source.
* **Phase 5 — streaming operators** ([`operators`] + [`stream`], bead `sq-vtba`): the
  [`SolutionStream`] boundary the client owns, the bounded blocking [`ScatterPool`], the
  `StreamJoin`-feeder [`StreamingJoin`], and the [`stream_single_source`] streaming
  interpreter — backpressured + bounded (Rust ownership + the reused StreamJoin spill).
* **Phase 6 — brTPF + TPF fragment adapters** ([`source`], bead `sq-2qze`): the real
  Triple-Pattern-Fragments adapters ([`TpfSource`] / [`BrTpfSource`]) over a
  [`FragmentTransport`] seam, complete-by-construction with count-metadata cardinality. The
  [`wire`] module (bead `sq-6ihg`) adds the brTPF binding-block transport encodings — a COMPACT
  self-describing BINARY mapping wire ([`encode_bindings`] / [`decode_bindings`]) alongside the
  line-oriented TEXT wire the server parses ([`encode_bindings_text`]), so a large bind-join
  block travels compactly and losslessly and the client can speak either form. The **native
  HTTP** [`FragmentTransport`](source::FragmentTransport) ([`HttpFragmentTransport`], bead
  `sq-yzca`) is the production seam — ureq + the same default-deny SSRF resolver, Hydra
  URI-template serialisation (`?subject=&predicate=&object=` + the brTPF `values` block),
  `hydra:next` pagination, and a Turtle/TriG fragment-body parse that splits the Hydra/VoID
  control triples from the data triples — and the [`operators`] interpreter is wired to answer
  a `JoinTree` leaf resolving to a TPF/brTPF source through its typed `solutions` path (via
  [`lower_leaf_fragment`]) rather than the SRJ `execute` a fragment server refuses.

* **Phase 7 — adaptive re-planning** (the `adaptive` module, bead `sq-ij5x`, the FINAL
  phase): the opt-in feedback loop that re-invokes [`sparq-fedplan`](sparq_fedplan)'s planner
  on the **unjoined remainder** when observed cardinality diverges from the static estimate,
  bounded to at most once per operator boundary — re-planning changes the plan, never the
  answer. Behind the extra default-OFF `fedclient-adaptive` feature (it pulls
  `sparq-fedplan/adaptive-replan`); when that feature is off the `adaptive` module and its
  `execute_adaptive_single_source` / `execute_adaptive_multi_source` entry points are
  `#[cfg]`-compiled out. The multi-source loop ([FABLE-5] sq-xw8zz) lifts the
  `MultiSource` guard — union-arm leaves with LIVE per-arm latency observations feeding
  the planner's per-source EWMA.

With Phase 7 the **8-phase streaming federation client is feature-complete** (Phases 0–7
all landed; epic sq-dnko closed). The public surface and the dependency boundary were made
visible before the logic landed.

# Opt-in (hard constraint)

The whole client is behind the **`fedclient` cargo feature, OFF by default**, and the
crate is a standalone workspace member with `publish = false`. `sparq-core` and
`sparq-engine` **never** depend on it — the dependency arrow points one-way *into*
the engine (the client reuses the engine's SERVICE transport + SSRF guard + local
eval), so the default engine build and the WASM artifact are byte-identical with or
without `sparq-fedclient`. A build that does not enable `fedclient` compiles an empty
crate (mirrors [`sparq-fedplan`](sparq_fedplan)'s `fedplan` feature).

# The dependency boundary (load-bearing, enforced)

The boundary was **proved before any logic existed** (Phase 0) and is re-checked on every
build. Two complementary checks enforce that neither `sparq-core` nor `sparq-engine` ever
gains a dependency edge *to* `sparq-fedclient`, in both feature states:

* `scripts/fedclient-boundary-guard.sh` — a CI step (in `feature-matrix.yml`) that
  inverts the dependency graph (`cargo tree -i sparq-fedclient`) and fails if
  `sparq-core` or `sparq-engine` appears as a dependent;
* `tests/boundary.rs` — a hermetic `cargo metadata` test asserting the same invariant
  from inside the test suite, so it gates even off the CI script.

Both must FAIL if a future edit introduces such an edge.
