//! End-to-end exercise of the PUBLIC per-method annotation-graph + over-claim guard
//! surface (`sparq_zk::secprop`, Phase 3, sq-bevd3). The module's unit tests pin the
//! internal invariants against the bundled Turtle; this integration test confirms the
//! PUBLIC API a downstream caller (e.g. the trust-graph admission gate, Phase 5) sees:
//! parse the graph, run all three over-claim guards, and check the source-layer
//! non-transfer rule through the public functions only.
//!
//! Behind the default-OFF `secprop-annotations` feature — the matching feature leg
//! exercises it (the silent-skip guard); a default build compiles this file out.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-bevd3 (epic sq-0dksu; design §5a). 🤖 SPARQ agent —
//! security-properties ontology.
