//! Trusted-ingest path: per-named-graph commitment with globally-unique salts
//! (plan §2.1–§2.2; soundness audit #9; tasks sq-610 + sq-cn8).
//!
//! This is "Stage 2" of the ingest-path commitment work. Stage 1 is the
//! per-graph commitment primitive ([`crate::commit::commit_triples`]) and the
//! `<urn:sparq:zk>` registry ([`crate::registry`]); this module is the trusted
//! orchestration that ties them together at mint time:
//!
//! 1. **Salt mint (sq-610).** Every named graph gets a salt drawn from
//!    [`SaltMint`], which fills 32 bytes from the OS CSPRNG ([`getrandom`]) and
//!    enforces **global uniqueness** across the whole ingest: every issued salt
//!    is tracked, a CSPRNG collision is redrawn, and any externally-supplied
//!    salt that collides with one already issued is *rejected* ([`SaltMint::register`]).
//!    The salt is the per-graph RDFC10 bnode salt (`zk:rdfc10Salt`): the Q6
//!    "bnodes from different graphs are distinct by construction" guarantee
//!    rests on it being globally unique, so this is the trusted-ingest
//!    enforcement the audit (#9) requires instead of an unenforced convention.
//!
//! 2. **Per-named-graph commitment (sq-cn8).** Each named graph is committed
//!    *separately* under its own minted salt, yielding one [`GraphCommitment`]
//!    per graph (NOT a single global commitment over the merged store). This is
//!    exactly the per-graph attribution the zk-trace consumer ([`crate::trace`])
//!    references by graph index and the per-property circuit witnesses block by
//!    block. The output is wired straight into a [`ZkDataset`] for traced
//!    execution and into [`RegistryEntry`]s for the `<urn:sparq:zk>` registry.
//!
//! # Soundness note (honest scope)
//! Salt uniqueness is enforced *at ingest*; the verifier-side / in-circuit
//! binding of the salt (so a salt-reusing prover cannot present a graph the
//! trusted ingest never minted) lives in the issuer signature
//! ([`crate::sig::commitment_message_with_salt`], audit #9 fix (a)) and is NOT
//! re-implemented here — this module is the *mint* side. A salt minted here is
//! globally unique within one [`SaltMint`] session; uniqueness across separate
//! processes/sessions rests on 248-bit CSPRNG entropy (collision probability
//! negligible), and a persistent ingester that must guarantee uniqueness across
//! restarts should seed the mint's seen-set from the existing registry (see
//! [`SaltMint::from_registry`]). What is deliberately deferred: in-circuit salt
//! binding (audit #9 fix (b)) and cross-process durable uniqueness state.
