//! # `store.rs` — trust-document storage / authoring model (`store` feature, opt-in)
//!
//! Where trust rules LIVE, how they are versioned + revoked, and how a server-wide
//! default composes with per-`.acr` documents — the P4 storage/authoring model of the
//! design record (`research/solid-trust-graph-authz-design.md` §3.2 / §8 Q1; epic
//! `sq-pfae`, bead `sq-pfae.5`). `policy.rs` answers *"what is one admission rule"*;
//! this module answers *"where does the policy come from, which version is in force, and
//! how do a server default and a per-`.acr` document combine"*.
//!
//! ## Two layers, one composition — BOTH, with per-`.acr` NARROWING (design §3.2)
//!
//! The §8 Q1 maintainer decision is **both** scopes, with the monotone discipline
//! ACP inheritance already uses:
//!
//! - [`TrustLayer::ServerWide`] — the server-wide default trust policy (one per
//!   server). It establishes the **ceiling**: a `(source, statement-type)` pair the
//!   server default does NOT trust can never be admitted, no matter what a deeper
//!   document says.
//! - [`TrustLayer::Container`] — a per-`.acr` trust document anchored at a container /
//!   resource path. It may only **NARROW** the server default: tighten the freshness
//!   window, restrict the scope to a sub-tree, or drop a source — it can **NEVER**
//!   introduce a new trusted `(source, statement-type)` the server default did not
//!   already grant. Broadening fails closed (the rule is simply not in the effective
//!   set). This is the load-bearing soundness property of the storage model
//!   ([`TrustStore::effective_rules`]): a writer who controls one container's `.acr`
//!   cannot widen trust beyond the server administrator's ceiling.
//!
//! ## Control-gating, versioning, revocation
//!
//! - **Control-gated.** A [`TrustDocument`] can only be built behind a
//!   [`ControlGate`](crate::policy::ControlGate) — the SAME fail-closed channel as
//!   `.acl`/`.acr` (§3.2). A document that did not arrive through Control cannot enter
//!   the store; there is no un-gated constructor.
//! - **Versioned.** Each document carries a monotone [`TrustDocument::version`]. An
//!   author bumps it on every edit; the store rejects a stale (≤ current) version on
//!   update ([`TrustStore::put`] returns [`StoreError::StaleVersion`]) so a replayed
//!   old document can never silently roll trust back.
//! - **Revoked.** Revocation is **document removal** ([`TrustStore::revoke`]): the
//!   document leaves the store and the [`PolicyVersion`] for every affected target
//!   bumps, so the composed admission decision is invalidated. (This matches the
//!   epoch-bump-on-rematerialise discipline — revocation propagates by re-materialise,
//!   §3.3 / G5; there is no in-place retraction inside a single reasoner run.)
//!
//! ## The admission cache key (composes with the sparq-solid epoch cache)
//!
//! [`AdmissionCacheKey`] `= (evidence_hash, policy_version)` is the design's §9.1
//! cache-key recipe made concrete:
//!
//! - `evidence_hash` — a stable hash of the presented credential's RDFC-1.0 commitment
//!   + bound holder (the per-credential evidence). Two requests presenting the SAME
//!   credential for the SAME holder share it.
//! - `policy_version` — the [`PolicyVersion`] for the target: the aggregate of the
//!   server-wide document version and every per-`.acr` document in force on the path to
//!   the target. ANY contributing document edit / revocation bumps it.
//!
//! It composes with the sparq-solid **epoch cache**: the host caches an admission
//! verdict under `(epoch, AdmissionCacheKey)`. A re-materialise bumps the epoch (drops
//! everything); a trust-document edit/revoke bumps the `policy_version` (drops only the
//! entries for affected targets); a different credential changes the `evidence_hash`.
//! So a stale verdict is NEVER served after either the auth view OR the trust policy
//! changed — the load-bearing invalidation property this module exists to provide.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! This is the STORAGE / AUTHORING model, not a new admission primitive: it decides
//! *which* [`TrustRule`]s are in force for a target and a cache key over them. It adds
//! NO cryptographic guarantee; the admission gate ([`mod@crate::admit`]) and its honest
//! caveats (no privacy/unlinkability; operator-asserted issuer keys; externally
//! UNAUDITED ZK estate — `sq-qhy4`) are unchanged.
//!
//! ## Certification-edge composition (`cert-graph` feature, opt-in)
//!
//! When the `cert-graph` feature is enabled, a [`TrustDocument`] may carry signed
//! [`crate::graph::Certification`] edges (via [`TrustDocument::with_certifications`]).
//! The store's [`TrustStore::effective_rules`] runs
//! `crate::graph::derive_effective_rules` over the document's direct rules and its
//! certification edges, so a certified issuer's rules are composed through the SAME
//! server-ceiling + per-`.acr` narrowing discipline — derived rules can only NARROW,
//! never BROADEN, the certifier's own anchor.
//!
//! The cache-safety invariant is load-bearing: [`TrustStore::policy_version`] folds
//! the certifier IRI, certified-issuer IRI, and the validity window (`valid_from` +
//! `valid_until`) of every certification into the hash.  Revoking a certification OR
//! re-authoring its validity window changes at least one of those fields (the document's
//! certification set loses an edge or the window shifts), which changes `policy_version`
//! and therefore the [`AdmissionCacheKey`].  Wall-clock expiry of an UNCHANGED
//! certification (time passing a fixed `valid_until` with no document edit) does NOT
//! turn the cache key over on its own — it propagates by re-materialise / epoch-bump
//! (like revocation), bounded by the host epoch cadence; the residual stale-authority
//! window is the acknowledged open problem tracked by `sq-l5og`.
//!
//! **Zero certifications ⇒ byte-identical to the pre-cert path.** With no
//! certifications the `with_certifications` constructor is unused, the `derive_effective_rules`
//! call is a no-op that returns `direct_rules` verbatim, and the `policy_version`
//! hash is unchanged (no certification entries are folded in).
