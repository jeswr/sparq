//! # `delegation.rs` — the invocation-binding gate (closes the §4 replay hole, `sq-l5og`)
//!
//! UCAN/ZCAP deliberately separate **delegation** (the signed chain document — *who
//! may act*) from **invocation** (exercising it on *this* request, key-bound to the
//! caller). The §4.1 "rides the admission rail" model captures the chain's
//! **existence** but **not** the per-request *invoker binding*. Without that binding an
//! admitted delegation becomes a **standing graph fact any session reaching it could
//! ride** — the exact replay / re-delegation escalation vector, the same severity class
//! as the §2.4 boundary re-opening.
//!
//! This module specifies and enforces the **missing rule** (design §4, `sq-l5og`,
//! the delegation analogue of §3.4 holder binding):
//!
//! > **authenticated invoker == the carried chain's terminal delegate, key-proven per
//! > request.**
//!
//! ## The invocation-binding gate (the algorithm — default-deny, short-circuit)
//!
//! ```text
//! invoke(chain, pop, session, target) -> EffectiveCapability | DENY:
//!   # 1. ANCHOR. The chain's root delegator must be a trust-anchored root key.
//!   if chain.root_key not in trusted_roots:                 DENY  # §4.1 anchor
//!   # 2. CHAIN INTEGRITY. Each hop is signed by its DELEGATOR's key over the hop
//!   #    message (delegator ‖ delegator_key ‖ delegate ‖ delegate_key ‖ capability ‖
//!   #    expiry), checked — never a self-asserted "I am delegated" triple (the
//!   #    §3.3-item-1 soundness condition). Binding delegate_key means the delegator
//!   #    ATTESTS which key the delegate holds — a substituted terminal key (the
//!   #    sq-l5og stolen-chain key-substitution vector) breaks this signature.
//!   for hop in chain.hops:
//!     if not verify_sig(hop.delegator_key, hop_message(hop), hop.sig):  DENY
//!   # 3. ATTENUATION (monotone narrowing, §4.2). Each hop may only RESTRICT: its
//!   #    capability ⊆ parent's, its expiry ≤ parent's. Never broadens the grant.
//!   for (parent, child) in adjacent(chain.hops):
//!     if not child.capability ⊆ parent.capability:          DENY  # §4.2
//!     if child.expiry > parent.expiry:                       DENY
//!   # 4. EXPIRY / FRESHNESS. The terminal hop must not be expired at Session.now
//!   #    (a per-request Rust check, like §3.3 B′ freshness — never in-reasoner).
//!   if session.now > terminal.expiry:                        DENY
//!   # 5. SCOPE. The terminal capability must cover the requested target.
//!   if not capability_covers(terminal.capability, target):  DENY
//!   # 6. INVOCATION BINDING (the core fix, §4.3-b). The authenticated invoker MUST
//!   #    BE the chain's terminal delegate AND prove possession of that key on THIS
//!   #    request via a fresh-challenge PoP (DPoP/GNAP-style). A captured chain alone
//!   #    cannot be ridden without the live terminal key + the live challenge.
//!   if terminal.delegate != session.agent:                   DENY  # invoker == delegate
//!   if not verify_pop(terminal.delegate_key, session.challenge, pop):  DENY  # key-proof
//!   emit EffectiveCapability{ capability: terminal.capability, delegate: terminal.delegate }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why this defeats stolen-chain replay (and the residual it does NOT close)
//!
//! The replay vector (§4.1 / §7.4-K′) is: an attacker reads an admitted delegation (a
//! standing graph fact, or captures it off the wire) and "rides" it. Defeating it rests
//! on **three** legs working together — step 6's two PoP legs PLUS the key being bound
//! into the signed chain (step 2):
//!
//! - **invoker == terminal delegate** — the request must authenticate AS the terminal
//!   delegate's WebID, not merely *reach* the delegation graph. Anyone else is denied.
//! - **fresh-challenge key-proof (PoP)** — even a session authenticated as the terminal
//!   delegate must sign a **per-request, server-issued challenge** with the terminal
//!   key. This is the GNAP/DPoP proof-of-possession the design names in §4.3(b) —
//!   modelled here on the SAME challenge-response Schnorr PoP the holder binding uses
//!   (`sparq-zk::sig` `holder_pop_message` / `sign_holder_pop`), so no new crypto is
//!   invented.
//! - **delegate_key bound into the signed hop (step 2, the `sq-l5og` soundness fix)** —
//!   the terminal `delegate_key` is folded into [`hop_message`], so the DELEGATOR's
//!   signature attests exactly which key the delegate holds. WITHOUT this, the PoP leg
//!   alone was bypassable: an attacker could substitute its OWN public key as the
//!   terminal `delegate_key` (the genuine WebID + the genuine delegator signature still
//!   verified, because the old preimage excluded the key), claim the genuine delegate's
//!   WebID, and produce a valid PoP under its *own* key. Binding the key makes any such
//!   substitution break the delegator's signature ⇒ the chain is rejected at step 2.
//!
//! **Residual (do NOT overclaim full non-replayability).** With the key bound, a chain
//! captured off the wire cannot have its terminal key swapped, so a captured chain alone
//! no longer yields a usable PoP under an attacker key. BUT the property is only as sound
//! as the trust in the delegate's key in the first place: the delegate key is attested by
//! the delegator's signature, and the delegator's OWN key is still **operator-/chain-
//! asserted** — there is no DID resolver binding a WebID to a key yet (`sq-pfae.3`, the
//! live forgery vector D′). So this gate defeats stolen-chain **key-substitution** replay;
//! it does NOT close the upstream key-trust gap. An adversary who can mint a chain rooted
//! at a key the relying party (wrongly) anchors, or who controls the delegator's asserted
//! key, is out of scope here and tracked by `sq-pfae.3`.
//!
//! ## Object-capability discipline — resolves the §4.1↔§4.3 ambient-authority tension (item M)
//!
//! The design records a self-contradiction (§7.4 item M): §4.1 stores delegations as
//! **ambient graph facts**, while §4.3(a)'s obj-cap discipline says *carry the chain
//! WITH the invocation, no ambient lookup*. **This module takes the obj-cap side
//! explicitly:** the chain is presented [`carried with the invocation`](DelegationChain)
//! — [`invoke`] never looks a chain up from an ambient graph. Storing a delegation as a
//! graph fact (the §4.1 model) is then merely an OPTIONAL audit record; it is **never**
//! the authority source, because [`invoke`] gates on the *carried* chain + the live PoP,
//! not on graph presence. That is the design choice this PoC makes for `sq-l5og`
//! (documented in the PR + bead note; flagged to the maintainer to steer — issue).
//!
//! ## Intersection invariant binds the CURRENT delegator grant (item N)
//!
//! [`effective_against_current`] composes the chain's terminal capability with the
//! **current** delegator grant (re-supplied per request), per §4.2:
//! `effective = terminal_capability ∩ current_delegator_grant`. It NEVER binds a
//! delegation-time snapshot — a stale snapshot would let an AI agent retain escalated
//! authority after the delegator's grant is revoked (§7.4 item N). The caller MUST pass
//! the freshly re-materialised delegator grant; this is the per-request discipline
//! (`sq-xc4y`'s delegation analogue).
//!
//! ## Open-problem hooks this gate RESPECTS (never silently solved)
//!
//! - **`sq-l5og` (this bead)** — the invocation-binding gate is now SPECIFIED, enforced,
//!   and tested (the replay analogue of `acp_forged_*_in_acr_document_does_not_grant`).
//!   What stays open and is documented (not solved): deep-chain *incremental* revocation
//!   (full re-materialisation only, so the §4.4 / item-N stale-authority window is bounded
//!   by re-materialisation cadence, NOT closed here), and DID-resolver key binding
//!   (`sq-pfae.3`, the live forgery vector D′ — delegate keys are operator-/chain-asserted).
//! - **`sq-xc4y`** — the gate is a **per-request** decision: it takes the live
//!   [`Invocation`] (challenge + PoP + now); it must be re-run per request, never frozen
//!   into a session-independent materialise-once view.
//! - **No privacy / unlinkability.** Like the attribute gate, the invoker authenticates
//!   in the **clear** (`terminal.delegate == Session.agent`); this is NOT an anonymous
//!   or unlinkable invocation. The ZK estate is research-grade and externally UNAUDITED
//!   (`sq-qhy4`).
//!
//! ## Honest scope — RESEARCH PROTOTYPE, NOT a security guarantee
//!
//! This closes the *specification + enforcement + test* gap the design flagged as
//! `sq-l5og`. It is a research prototype to take to the LWS/Solid WGs, **not** a shipped
//! feature or a security guarantee. It does not provide a DID resolver, anonymity, deep
//! incremental revocation, or an external-audited crypto path.

///
/// Binding `delegate_key` (and `delegator_key`) is **load-bearing**, not cosmetic. If the
/// delegate's key were excluded, the TERMINAL hop's `delegate_key` would be attested by NO
/// signature: the linkage check only constrains the keys of NON-terminal hops (`hops[i]`'s
/// delegate-key == `hops[i+1]`'s delegator-key), and the per-request PoP merely verifies a
/// signature *against* whatever `delegate_key` is presented. An attacker could then capture
/// the chain off the wire, substitute its OWN public key as the terminal `delegate_key`
/// (the genuine WebID + the genuine delegator signature would still verify, because they
/// would not cover the key), set `inv.agent` to the genuine delegate's WebID, and sign the
/// fresh challenge with its own key — riding the stolen chain. Folding `delegate_key` into
/// `hop_message` closes this: substituting the terminal key now breaks the *delegator's*
/// signature over the hop, so the chain is rejected at step 2 (`HopSignatureInvalid`).
/// Every hop (including the terminal) binds its key, so the property holds chain-wide.
///
/// This is the delegation analogue of `sparq_zk::sig::commitment_message`: a
/// domain-separated message so a delegation signature can never be confused with a
/// credential-commitment signature or a holder-PoP signature (distinct domain tags).
///
/// The delegator signs this via `SecretKey::sign_commitment` (which wraps it in
/// `commitment_message` before signing), and [`invoke`] verifies against the same
/// wrapped form — so the value returned here is the *pre-wrap* hop message.
///
/// ## Wire-format / back-compat note
///
/// Folding the keys CHANGES the signed preimage: a `signature_hex` produced over the
/// pre-fix message (keys excluded) will NOT verify under this message, and vice versa.
/// This is intentional — the pre-fix preimage was forgeable (see above). There is no
