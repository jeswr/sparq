//! # `admit.rs` — the admission gate (default-deny, short-circuit)
//!
//! For a presented credential graph `G`, the parsed `Vec<TrustRule>`, and the live
//! [`Session`], emit the `Vec<AdmittedFact>` that pass admission. The algorithm is
//! the design's §6.0 pseudocode, run exactly (short-circuit on first failure;
//! default-deny):
//!
//! ```text
//! admit(G, rules, session) -> admitted:
//!   cG := canonicalise(G)                              # sparq-canon RDFC-1.0
//!   for r in rules:
//!     if not scope_covers(r.scope, target):     continue
//!     if not verify_sig(cG.commitment, r.key):  continue   # CHECKED issuer sig
//!     if session.now - issued_at(G) > r.fresh:  continue   # per-request Rust check
//!     if revoked(G):                            continue   # input-stratified guard
//!     for t=(s,p,o) in G:
//!       if is_reserved(p):                      continue   # solidx:/urn:sparq: guard
//!       if not shape_admits(r.shape, t, G):     continue   # sparq-shacl
//!       if subject_of(t) != session.agent:      continue   # §3.4 holder binding
//!       emit AdmittedFact{ t, issuer: r.source, mark: trust:admitted }
//! ```
//!
//! `verify_sig`, `revoked`, freshness, and holder-binding are **Rust side-conditions**
//! (per-request, NOT in-reasoner — §3.3 B′); `shape_admits` runs the shipped,
//! terminating `sparq-shacl` validator; `scope_covers` is a containment check.
//!
//! ## The static / dynamic admission split (the `sq-xc4y` resolution)
//!
//! Admission has TWO classes of condition with DIFFERENT lifetimes (design §3.3
//! ADMISSION-VS-MATERIALIZE-ONCE GAP):
//!
//! - **STATIC** — the issuer signature over the RDFC-1.0 commitment, the
//!   statement-type scope (SHACL shape), the reserved-predicate guard, and the
//!   `trust:scope` containment. These depend ONLY on the credential + the policy, NOT
//!   on the request. They are session-independent and can be decided **once, at
//!   materialise-time**, exactly like the WAC/ACP derivation stratum.
//! - **DYNAMIC** — the holder binding (`credentialSubject == Session.agent`) and
//!   freshness (`Session.now - issued_at ≤ freshWithin`). These are **per-request**
//!   facts. They MUST be re-evaluated on every request and must NOT be frozen into the
//!   session-independent materialise-once view.
//!
//! [`admit`] runs BOTH classes against a single live [`Session`] (the snapshot path:
//! the decision is valid for *that* request only). [`admit_static`] runs ONLY the
//! static class and returns each fact carrying the dynamic conditions it still owes
//! ([`StaticAdmittedFact::holder`] and [`StaticAdmittedFact::not_after_unix_secs`]) so
//! the caller can install a **conditional grant** whose holder/freshness are re-checked
//! per request at query time — the shipped sq-0q7n `auth:notBefore`/`auth:notAfter`
//! conditional-grant precedent (`sparq-solid` `AuthIndex::cond_applies`). This is the
//! `sq-xc4y` decision **(a) split static-admission from dynamic-admission**, NOT
//! **(b) per-request re-materialise**: the static stratum composes with the epoch
//! cache, the dynamic conditions ride the existing per-request conditional-grant path.
//!
//! ## Open-problem hooks this gate RESPECTS (does not silently solve)
//!
//! - **`sq-xc4y`** (holder-binding/freshness are per-request) — RESOLVED by the
//!   static/dynamic split above: [`admit_static`] emits the static decision once and
//!   defers holder/freshness to the per-request conditional-grant check, so a stale or
//!   wrong-holder credential is denied at query time WITHOUT a re-materialise and is
//!   never frozen into the materialise-once view. The combined [`admit`] remains the
//!   per-request snapshot path for a single request.
//! - **`sq-wvne` / `sq-xc4y` (holder binding)** — the holder binding is the
//!   **clear-WebID v1 path** (`credentialSubject == Session.agent`), the
//!   **non-anonymous degraded path**. It authenticates the requester's WebID in the
//!   CLEAR; it does **NOT** deliver unlinkable/anonymous presentation. This is the
//!   documented degradation, not a solved problem.
//! - **`sq-tu4e`** — `revoked` is an **input-only** seeded predicate (a per-request
//!   Rust check here), never in-reasoner negation over a derived fact; there is **no
//!   deny-on-disagreement** rule in this PoC.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! This gate verifies a CHECKED issuer signature; it does **NOT** provide privacy,
//! unlinkability, anonymity, or any cryptographic guarantee. The ZK estate it
//! composes with is research-grade and **externally UNAUDITED** (`sq-qhy4`). The issuer
//! key is operator-asserted by default (the `issuerKey → verifying-key` binding is the
//! live forgery vector D′ of §3.3); the opt-in `did` feature (`sq-pfae.3`, the `did`
//! module) can bind it from a `trust:issuerDid` instead, narrowing — not eliminating — D′.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-pfae PoC (issue #940). 🤖 SPARQ agent — trust-graph authorisation PoC.

// ── Phase 5: the opt-in property-admissibility PRE-CHECK (sq-dt5hv) ────────────
//
// A single OPTIONAL pre-admission check (design §5b), behind the default-OFF
// `secprop-precheck` feature. Before the existing signature / freshness / holder
// checks, consult the merged secprop admissibility reduction
// (`crate::admissibility::admissible`) to decide whether the PRESENTED proof method
// satisfies the requester's ODRL privacy preference. Fail-closed (default-deny): a
// method that does NOT satisfy every constraint admits NOTHING — a **principled
// refusal** ("no admissible proof") rather than serving a non-conforming one.
//
// STRICT ADDITIVITY: the pre-check is consulted ONLY when a caller passes a
// `AdmissibilityPreference`; with `None` the gate is **byte-identical** to `admit`
// (the opt-in property G6 — the same posture the rest of this crate keeps). It does NOT
// redefine the reduction: it is a thin driver that hands the method's annotation graph
// and the requester's `gteq` constraints to the Phase-2 `admissible()` API.
