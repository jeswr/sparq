//! [FABLE-5] sq-tonhr.6 COEXISTENCE differential — the generated parser vs
//! `sparq-shacl`'s hand-rolled standard-SCS parser (`scs` feature) on every
//! fixture BOTH accept: identical triple sets up to bnode relabelling.
//!
//! Scope is the standard `valid/` corpus — the hand-rolled parser covers the
//! W3C CG surface only (no rdf12 layer, no extensions), so those fixtures
//! are exactly the shared language. A fixture the hand-rolled parser
//! REJECTS is skipped loudly (reported in the assertion message if the
//! count drifts), never silently.
