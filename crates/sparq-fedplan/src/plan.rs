//! **Join planning**: a greedy join-order heuristic over the selected sources, with a
//! per-join **bind-vs-hash** algorithm decision, producing a [`JoinTree`] of estimated
//! cardinalities and costs.
//!
//! ## Inputs
//!
//! The planner consumes the per-pattern source selection ([`crate::select_sources`]) —
//! each pattern's retained sources and their CostFed cardinality estimates — plus the
//! source descriptors (for characteristic-set star-join cardinality). It never touches
//! the network: every estimate comes from the descriptors.
//!
//! ## Join order (greedy, selectivity-first)
//!
//! Start from the lowest-cardinality pattern; repeatedly join the connected pattern
//! (sharing a variable with the result so far) whose join yields the smallest estimated
//! output. This is the standard greedy left-deep heuristic; it avoids Cartesian
//! products while any connected pattern remains, and falls back to the next smallest
//! disconnected pattern only when the result component is exhausted. Ties break on
//! pattern index for determinism.
//!
//! ## Intermediate-result cardinality
//!
//! When several joined patterns form a **star** (share a subject variable, with bound
//! predicates), the size of joining the next star arm is estimated from the
//! characteristic sets — Neumann & Moerkotte's `Σ_{C⊇Q} count(C)·Π avg_mult` — which
//! captures the predicate *correlation* a per-predicate-independence product loses
//! (CS estimates are taken on the source contributing the star; a multi-source star
//! sums per source). Non-star joins fall back to an independence estimate scaled by the
//! joined predicate's selectivity.
//!
//! ## Bind vs hash (the per-join algorithm decision)
//!
//! For a join of a left intermediate result (`L` rows) with a right pattern
//! (`R` rows total over its sources, fan-out `f` = expected matches per bound value):
//!
//! * **Bind join** — issue, per left row, a bound request to the right's sources
//!   (`?s p ?o` with `?s` bound). Cost ≈ `L · (req + f)`: one request per left row plus
//!   the matched rows. Wins when `L` is small and the right is selective per bound value
//!   (small `f`). This is the SERVICE-style nested-loop / VALUES-pushdown join.
//! * **Hash / symmetric join** — scan both sides once and hash-join locally. Cost ≈
//!   `R + L`: one full retrieval of each side. Wins when `L` is large (so per-row
//!   requests would dominate) or the right is unselective.
//!
//! The planner picks the cheaper of the two estimated costs; the per-request constant
//! `req` (the round-trip penalty that makes bind joins expensive at scale) is the knob
//! in [`PlanOptions::request_cost`]. The decision *flips* as `L` grows past the point
//! where `L·req` overtakes `R`.
//!
//! ## Streaming (sq-vf7q)
//!
//! A third [`JoinAlgo::Streaming`] choice marks a hash-class join for **non-blocking
//! streaming execution with operator spill** (the [`crate::StreamJoin`] operator). The
//! planner picks it over a plain [`JoinAlgo::Hash`] when both inputs are large enough
//! that materialising a side up front is the risk: the combined estimated input rows
//! exceed [`PlanOptions::stream_threshold`]. It is the same abstract cost as Hash (one
//! scan per side) — the difference is the execution discipline (emit-as-you-go, bounded
//! memory), not the cost. Setting the threshold to `f64::INFINITY` disables it.
//!
//! ## Adaptive re-planning (sq-7s4z)
//!
//! `plan_bgp` itself stays a **static** planner — it commits to one order from the
//! estimates it is given. Live **mid-execution re-planning** (re-invoking the planner on
//! the remaining patterns when observed cardinalities diverge) lives in [`crate::adaptive`]
//! behind the opt-in `adaptive-replan` feature, which re-uses this module's cost model via
//! the crate-internal `cost_join_pub`. Mid-*operator* swaps remain deferred.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-a35t / sq-vf7q / sq-7s4z.
