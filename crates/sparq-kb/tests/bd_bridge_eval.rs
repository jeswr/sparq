//! bd-bridge eval — the bd→RDF read-model + the §4.5 four-criterion replacement gate.
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-2m6zm.5 (epic sq-2m6zm). 🤖 SPARQ agent — dogfooding sparq as a
//! project knowledge graph. Written while Fable unavailable; flag for re-review when
//! Fable returns.
//!
//! This is the SCIENTIFIC, non-sycophantic answer to the maintainer's question:
//! *can sparq REPLACE bd entirely?* The design record
//! (`research/dogfooding-sparq-knowledge-graph.md` §4) recommends **bridge, do NOT
//! replace** until a four-criterion gate (§4.5) is met on real data. This test
//! EVALUATES that gate over the real backlog (`.beads/issues.jsonl`, projected to
//! `pkg:Task` triples by `ingest/ingest_pkg.py`).
//!
//! What it proves:
//!   1. The bd→RDF read-model loads + is queryable (the projection is faithful).
//!   2. THREE+ structural queries that are awkward/impossible in `bd`'s flat CLI:
//!      (a) transitive blocked-by chains via a SPARQL property path;
//!      (b) the ready-frontier computed in SPARQL (the §4.1 dependency half);
//!      (c) the knowledge↔task JOIN — research designs with vs without a covering
//!      open bead — which `bd` CANNOT express (it has no model of the corpus).
//!   3. The §4.5 gate, scored HONESTLY per criterion, reaching a bridge-vs-replace
//!      verdict. The verdict is asserted (so the eval is a regression-tested fact,
//!      not prose): all four criteria FAIL for replacement on the read-model alone,
//!      so the honest verdict is **BRIDGE**.
//!
//! Every result row is computed by sparq's own SPARQL engine over the projected
//! graph — `O(answer)` tokens, not `O(corpus)`; within the store the answer cannot be
//! fabricated. Run:
//!   `cargo test -p sparq-kb --features query --test bd_bridge_eval -- --nocapture`
