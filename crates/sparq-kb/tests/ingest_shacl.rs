//! SHACL conformance gate over the **ingested** PKG graph (sq-2m6zm.2).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-2m6zm.2 (epic sq-2m6zm). 🤖 SPARQ agent — PKG ingestion PoC. The
//! ingested graph (`ingest/pkg-instances.ttl`: the mechanical bd→Task projection +
//! the skills-front-matter Sources/Techniques + the hand-authored AGENTS.md Findings)
//! is run through sparq's own SHACL engine against the §2.4/§4.4 write-time
//! guardrails. The gate: **0 violations** (the guardrail working — extraction was
//! fixed until it conformed; the bd backlog's 55 stale closed→open edges are
//! guardrail-excluded by the ingest script, not silently dropped).
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p sparq-kb --features validate --test ingest_shacl -- --nocapture`
