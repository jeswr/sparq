//! Write-path YAML-LD authoring form — the round-trip + SHACL-conformance gate
//! (FO-bridge Phase 4, sq-mztg8.2; epic sq-mztg8).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] 🤖 SPARQ agent. Design record: `research/fo-llm-bridge.md` §3.4 / §6
//! Phase 4 (#1112). Written while Fable unavailable; flag for re-review when Fable
//! returns.
//!
//! The write-path lets the AGENTS.md Findings tier be AUTHORED in a compact, IRI-free
//! `ingest/agents-findings.yaml.ld` and deterministically COMPILED (by
//! `ingest/yamlld_compile.py`) to the schema.org-typed PKG Turtle the SHACL shapes
//! admit. This test pins the two load-bearing invariants of the bead's acceptance
//! criterion, over the REAL parse + SHACL path (not a mock):
//!
//!   1. **SHACL conformance (the acceptance gate / kill-criterion K5):** the COMPILED
//!      Findings tier (`PKG_FINDINGS`) conforms to `pkg.shapes.ttl` with **0
//!      violations** — at parity with the hand-authored tier it replaces.
//!   2. **Round-trip equivalence:** the compiled Findings carry the SAME triple set as
//!      the frozen, hand-authored `agents-findings.ttl` the human wrote before the
//!      write-path existed (the fixture in `tests/fixtures/`). So the deterministic
//!      compiler reproduces the hand-authored tier — it did not quietly drop or invent
//!      a fact.
//!
//! (The compiler's parser / guarded-`V()` resolver / ambiguous-token-is-a-hard-error
//! behaviour is regression-covered by the hermetic Python self-test
//! `scripts/tests/test_yamlld_compile.py`, run in the docs-quality lane.)
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p sparq-kb --features validate --test yamlld_write_path -- --nocapture`
