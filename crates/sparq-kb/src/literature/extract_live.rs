//! The **live cheap-model batch extractor** behind the `extract::Extractor` trait — the
//! Phase-6 slot the record/replay design left open (§4.3, §4.7). [SONNET-4.6] sq-tzars.6
//! (epic `sq-tzars`, design records `research/research-kb-program.md` +
//! `research/provenance-driven-genai-kb.md`). 🤖 SPARQ agent — research-KB live ingestion.
//!
//! ## What this is (and the honesty invariants it holds)
//!
//! `LiveExtractor` turns a batch of `SourceStub`s into candidate `CandidateFinding`s by
//! shelling out to a Claude Code sub-agent (a headless `claude` invocation — no separate
//! Anthropic API key is needed on a box where the CLI is already authenticated, per GH
//! #1139) with a strict JSON-only prompt, then parsing the transcript. It is the ONLY
//! LLM-in-the-loop step, isolated behind the same trait `RecordedExtractor` implements, so:
//!
//! 1. **CI makes ZERO live model calls.** The pure prompt-build / transcript-parse / cap
//!    logic is exercised over COMMITTED recorded transcripts; the subprocess seam
//!    (`CommandRunner`) is behind the default-OFF `literature-live` feature AND is inert
//!    until its command is configured (`SPARQ_KB_EXTRACT_CMD`, default-unset). Record/replay
//!    stays the only test path.
//! 2. **Machine-tier caps are enforced DEFENSIVELY at the boundary** — in ADDITION to the
//!    SHACL gate and the pipeline downgrade, never instead of them. Every parsed candidate
//!    has its confidence CLAMPED to `MACHINE_CONFIDENCE_CEILING` and any `Proven` assurance
//!    MAPPED DOWN to `Claimed` — even if the model output claims otherwise. A candidate
//!    whose justification is not a normalised span of its source abstract is REJECTED at the
//!    boundary as a likely hallucination — and COUNTED (`BoundaryReject`: source DOI +
//!    reason category, no text), never silently dropped, so the pilot's run metrics carry
//!    the fetched→extracted honesty gap (`sq-tx8v9`); the deterministic grounding-resolver
//!    (`ground`) still independently re-checks every survivor — this boundary check never
//!    bypasses it.
//! 3. **Extraction errors surface, never swallowed.** A failed sub-agent invocation, a
//!    transcript with no JSON, or a malformed candidate is an `Err` — never an empty
//!    success. A failed batch quarantines at the pipeline; it never silently zeroes findings.
//!
//! ## The two-layer split (mirrors `connector_core`)
//!
//! - The **pure** layer (`build_batch_prompt`, `parse_transcript`, `extract_json_block`, the
//!   `SubagentRunner` seam, `LiveExtractor`) is behind `literature`. It makes NO subprocess
//!   call — it drives an injected `SubagentRunner`, so CI exercises the whole path over a
//!   fake runner + committed transcripts with ZERO processes spawned.
//! - The **live** layer (`CommandRunner`) is behind `literature-live`. It is the ONLY part
//!   that spawns a process, the command is CONFIGURABLE + default-unset, and it is NEVER
//!   driven in CI.
