//! The **record/replay extract trait** — the only LLM-in-the-loop step, isolated so CI
//! runs on a committed tape and makes ZERO live model calls (§4.7).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-2489d.5. A cheap-model extractor turns a paper's abstract into candidate
//! `pkg:Finding`s. That is the single non-deterministic, credential-requiring step in the
//! pipeline; everything around it (connector, grounding, emit, SHACL gate) is
//! deterministic. By expressing extraction as the [`Extractor`] trait we can:
//!
//! - run CI entirely on [`RecordedExtractor`] (replays [`super::FIXTURE_EXTRACTIONS`]), and
//! - drop in a real cheap-model batch extractor later (Phase 6, `needs-access`) behind the
//!   *same* trait, with no change to the rest of the pipeline.
