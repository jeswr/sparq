//! The **deterministic grounding-resolver** — propose-then-verify (§4.3, the OPEN
//! `sq-0wo9e.6` pattern, realised here for the fixture pipeline).
//!
//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-2489d.5. A cheap model **will hallucinate claims and mis-cite**. The
//! SHACL gate checks *structure*, not *truth*; the strongest deterministic anchor we can
//! add is to require, before a candidate Finding is allowed to be committed, that:
//!
//! 1. its **justification is an entailed span of the source abstract** — a normalised
//!    substring of the abstract the candidate was extracted from (so a fabricated
//!    "justification" that does not appear in the text is rejected); AND
//! 2. every **cited DOI resolves to a `pkg:Source` actually in the batch** (so a dangling
//!    citation to a paper not in the corpus is rejected).
//!
//! A candidate that fails EITHER check is **quarantined, not committed** (the
//! `super::pipeline` does the quarantining; this module is the pure verifier). Neither
//! check establishes truth — a well-formed, in-corpus, text-anchored claim can still be
//! false; the docs say so and the machine tier stays `secx:Conjectured` accordingly.
