//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-qo1a9 (epic sq-pbz04, the LAST conformance bead) — the GRADUATED
//! OWL 2 QL (DL-Lite_R) certain-answer oracle ratchet.
//!
//! ## What this GRADUATES — and the honest scope
//!
//! The QL query-rewriting LOGIC (PerfectRef ∪ bounded tree-witness ∪
//! UCQ-containment minimisation) landed oracle-PROVEN in #1297 (sq-g19x0). It was
//! then wired into the `sparql11/entailment` arm as EXPERIMENTAL / OutOfScope in
//! #1312 (sq-kuvu3) — NO floor — because that broad `pr:QL` set is NOT the formal
//! OWL2-QL / DL-Lite_R suite: it mixes intensional / non-DL-Lite certain-answer
//! cases the sound query-rewriting fragment cannot answer (20 abstain / 10
//! computed-equivalent / 1 computed-DIVERGENT). That arm stays experimental
//! (`tests/ql_experimental_arm.rs` — untouched here).
//!
//! THIS lane graduates the FORMAL DL-Lite_R suite — the hand-derived oracle from
//! sq-g19x0 — to a pinned floor. Every case in `QL_DLLITE_ORACLE` is a conjunctive
//! query WITHIN sound DL-Lite_R rewriting, with a certain-answer set derived BY
//! HAND from the DL-Lite_R semantics (independently of the rewriter). The runner
//! rewrites each case with `rewrite_production`, evaluates the UCQ over the
//! UNMODIFIED ABox through the REAL engine, and asserts it returns EXACTLY the
//! certain answers — sound (no extra) AND complete (no missing) case by case. The
//! floor is the count of cases on which that holds.
//!
//! ## Why a sparq-EXTENSION row, NOT a standards-conformance number (the HONEST scope)
//!
//! There is no runnable normative W3C "OWL 2 QL certain-answer conformance suite"
//! to point a harness at — the W3C QL test material is structural/classification,
//! not an answer-comparison corpus over the query-rewriting semantics. So — exactly
//! like the RIF-Core expressivity / RSP-SRBench / BM25 oracles in this crate — this
//! is a faithful sparq-OWN oracle, registered as `family = "sparq extension"` and
//! tallied SEPARATELY in the central scoreboard, NEVER folded into the
//! standards-conformance total. It is HONESTLY a DL-Lite_R certain-answer oracle
//! floor, NOT a full-OWL-2-QL-conformance claim. The broad `pr:QL` entailment-arm
//! gap (the 1 intensional divergence) is documented + tracked, never summed in.
//!
//! ## Fail-closed + no faked passes
//!
//! Every case is rewritten through the REAL `rewrite_production` path (the
//! fail-closed CQ-shape gate runs first); a query it cannot soundly rewrite ABSTAINS
//! (reported, never a guessed pass), and the floor counts ONLY `SoundAndComplete`
//! outcomes. No case is special-cased — the certain answers are an independent
//! ground truth, so a rewriter regression that drops or invents an answer fails this
//! ratchet immediately.
//!
//! ## Feature gating (both states)
//!
//! The whole lane is behind this crate's opt-in `ql-experimental` feature (forwards
//! to `sparq-reason-ql/experimental`). With the feature OFF this file compiles to a
//! single self-SKIP `#[test]` (no QL rewriter links — the lean opt-in posture, so
//! the default + `--workspace` byte/bundle ratchets are byte-for-byte unchanged).
//! The corpus is IN-SOURCE (no fetched fixtures), so the lane runs on any checkout.
//! `QL_DLLITE_FLOOR` is read TEXTUALLY by `tests/scoreboard_floors.rs`, so the
//! central scoreboard's mirrored value can never silently drift.

// [OPUS-4.8] When the lane feature is OFF the runner is a single self-SKIP test so
// the default + `--workspace` builds neither link the QL rewriter nor go red. (cfg
// gate, not a runtime branch — zero QL code compiles in the default state, the
// lean-core invariant.)
