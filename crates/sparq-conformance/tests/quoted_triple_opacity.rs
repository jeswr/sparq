//! [KERN] RDF 1.2 quoted-triple OPACITY conformance — "quoting never asserts"
//! and closure non-interference, pinned against the REAL reasoning profiles.
//!
//! ## What is pinned
//!
//! RDF 1.2 makes a quoted/reified triple a TERM: `:r rdf:reifies <<( :s :p :o )>>`
//! asserts one triple about `:r` and NOTHING about `:s :p :o` (triple terms are
//! referentially opaque — RDF 1.2 Semantics, triple terms; RDF 1.2 Concepts,
//! "Reifying triples"). sparq-core already stores triple terms structurally
//! (`Dict::intern_triple_ids`; `ttl.rs` / `nt.rs` desugar the `<< … >>` and
//! `{| … |}` forms exactly like oxttl). This lane pins the REASONER side of that
//! contract, per profile (RDFS + OWL 2 RL via `sparq_reason::materialize`;
//! OWL 2 EL classification behind the `el-suite` feature):
//!
//! 1. **Quoting never asserts** — a graph with a reified triple `<< s p o >>`
//!    (any surface form: explicit `rdf:reifies` + triple term, reified-triple
//!    term as subject/object, fresh or named reifier) does NOT entail `s p o`,
//!    nor any consequence of it (domain/range typings, sub-property fan-out),
//!    unless `s p o` is separately asserted. The ANNOTATION form
//!    `s p o {| … |}` — which per RDF 1.2 DOES assert `s p o` — is the fixture's
//!    positive control proving the guarded rules genuinely fire when a triple
//!    IS asserted.
//! 2. **Closure non-interference** — the closure of a base graph is
//!    BYTE-IDENTICAL whether or not quoted triples referring to it (a true one,
//!    a false one, an entailed-but-unasserted one, a reversed one) are present:
//!    `closure(base ∪ overlay) == closure(base) ∪ overlay`, with
//!    `closure(base)` additionally byte-pinned against a committed
//!    expected-answer file (`tests/quoted_opacity/expected/*.nt`, sorted
//!    N-Triples — hand-verified, see `quoted_opacity/README.md`).
//! 3. **Reifier annotations reason normally** — a reifier's own annotations
//!    (`:statedBy` under an `rdfs:domain`, a subclass hop) participate in the
//!    closure like any other triples, WITHOUT leaking the quoted content.
//!
//! ## The ratchet
//!
//! `QUOTED_OPACITY_FLOOR` is the MEASURED count of opacity assertions the
//! battery makes (the `quoted-triple opacity assertions N (floor F)` line the
//! runner prints); it may only RISE. It is MIRRORED in the central scoreboard
//! (`scoreboard::SUITES`) and read TEXTUALLY by `tests/scoreboard_floors.rs`.
//! The lane is UNGATED (plain `sparq_reason::materialize`, default features,
//! no fetched data) so it runs in ordinary `cargo test --workspace`; the EL arm
//! alone is behind the existing opt-in `el-suite` feature (it links the
//! `sparq-reason-el` classifier) and does NOT count toward the floor, so the
//! measured count is feature-independent.
