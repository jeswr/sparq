//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-jaj38 (epic sq-my8wd) — the W3C SPARQL 1.1 **Protocol** (HTTP layer)
//! conformance lane, wired as a RATCHETED gate that mirrors the SPARQL / SHACL / GeoSPARQL /
//! Solid / JSON-LD / D-entailment / sparql11-service ratchets in this crate (crate-local
//! `cargo test` + a pinned pass-count FLOOR that may only RISE, registered in the central
//! `scoreboard::SUITES` and guarded by `tests/scoreboard_floors.rs`).
//!
//! ## What is gated
//!
//! The SPARQL 1.1 **Protocol** operations exercised against the merged in-process loopback
//! server (sq-ushvx, #1291) over RAW HTTP — query via GET / POST-urlencoded / POST-direct, the
//! HTTP `QUERY` method (#1304), update via POST, the `default-graph-uri` / `named-graph-uri`
//! dataset overrides, result-format content negotiation for SELECT/ASK
//! (`application/sparql-results+json`, `+xml`, `text/csv`, `text/tab-separated-values`) and the
//! documented status codes (200/400/405/415). Each assertion is a real HTTP request to the
//! bound ephemeral `127.0.0.1:0` port, checking the status / `Content-Type` / payload shape.
//! See [`sparq_conformance::http_protocol`] for the per-assertion catalogue.
//!
//! ## Honest floor + the documented-divergence remainder
//!
//! `HTTP_PROTOCOL_FLOOR` is the MEASURED count of PASS assertions, NOT an aspirational target;
//! MIRRORED in `scoreboard::SUITES` and read textually by `tests/scoreboard_floors.rs`. It may
//! only RISE. [OPUS-4.8] sq-406acc: a present-but-unsatisfiable `Accept` now genuinely returns
//! 406 (Oxigraph parity) — a PASS, raising the floor 20→21. The remaining documented divergences
//! (an absent / `*/*` Accept defaults to JSON per the W3C-permitted default; an ASK boolean in
//! CSV/TSV falls back to a JSON boolean) are recorded as DOCUMENTED DIVERGENCES and are NOT summed
//! into the floor, so a documented gap can never inflate the conformance number; a genuine FAILURE
//! always fails the gate.
//!
//! ## Feature gating (both states)
//!
//! Behind this crate's opt-in `http-protocol` feature (forwards to `service-loopback` → tokio +
//! axum via `sparq-server/server`; NO new third-party dep — the raw HTTP client is a std-only
//! `TcpStream` helper). With the feature OFF this file compiles to a single self-SKIP `#[test]`
//! (no tokio/axum linked here — the lean opt-in posture).
//!
//!   cargo test -p sparq-conformance --features http-protocol --test http_protocol_suite
