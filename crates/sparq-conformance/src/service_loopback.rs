//! [OPUS-4.8] sq-ushvx (epic sq-my8wd) — in-process SERVICE-federation test harness.
//!
//! This is the **federation keystone** for the SERVICE / HTTP-protocol conformance
//! program (design record `research/service-federation-conformance.md`, Option C): a
//! reusable fixture that stands up a **real** [`sparq_server::serve`] endpoint over a
//! fixture graph on an **ephemeral** `127.0.0.1:0` loopback port, returns the bound URL,
//! and tears the server down cleanly on drop. A federated query is then driven through
//! the engine's **real** `ureq` HTTP transport ([`sparq_engine::query`] under the
//! `service` feature), so the *whole* federated path — HTTP request/response, `Accept`
//! content negotiation, SPARQL-Results-JSON/XML parsing, the bind-join over the wire — is
//! exercised end-to-end, not a `pub(crate)` canned-mock seam.
//!
//! Later beads under sq-my8wd wire the W3C `sparql11/service` evaluation suite and the
//! HTTP-protocol suites onto this harness; this bead delivers only the reusable fixture
//! plus a smoke test, and deliberately does **not** graduate a conformance floor yet.
//!
//! ## SSRF egress scoping (load-bearing invariant)
//!
//! A loopback address (`127.0.0.0/8`) is refused by the engine's default-deny SSRF egress
//! filter ([`sparq_engine::with_service_egress_allow`]). The harness opts the loopback
//! host back in for the **duration of the single federated query only** (a scoped guard,
//! restored on return/unwind) — it does **NOT** disable the egress filter globally. The
//! DNS-rebinding-safe resolver stays fully installed and re-vets every resolved IP, so the
//! invariant the engine guarantees (vetted-IP == dialled-IP, no resolve/re-resolve TOCTOU)
//! is preserved. See [`LoopbackEndpoint::run_federated`].
//!
//! **Honest boundary:** the engine's egress allowlist is keyed by *bare host* (it has no
//! port granularity — `sparq_engine::service::egress_policy` matches the SERVICE IRI
//! authority host, not `host:port`). The harness therefore allowlists exactly the bound
//! loopback **host** (`127.0.0.1`), which under the default-deny-*private* policy re-opens
//! only that one private host while every other private/internal destination stays
//! refused. Within a single test process this is the finest scoping the engine offers; a
//! genuinely port-scoped engine allowlist (so two concurrent loopback endpoints on
//! different ports are mutually unreachable) is a separately-reviewable engine change to
//! the SSRF primitive and is tracked as a follow-up (see the crate README / PR body). The
//! harness binds each endpoint to a fresh ephemeral port and the smoke test asserts the
//! SERVICE IRI targets exactly that bound port, so the *test* scope is the bound port even
//! though the *engine guard* is host-wide.
