//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-gos8, epic sq-toze) **Opt-in RICHER structured access-audit sink** — a
//! pluggable sink that records every enforced access decision as a structured, typed event
//! for a security / compliance audit trail. Maps to ASVS V7 (logging) / ISO 27001 A.8.15
//! (logging) / CDMC CD-2 (access audit).
//!
//! This is the heavier sibling of the `crate::audit` module (`audit-log`). Where `audit-log`
//! emits a single flat `tracing` event per request (requester fingerprint, op class, query
//! fingerprint, decision, status, duration) for operators who route a `tracing` target to a
//! sink, THIS module emits a **typed, self-describing access RECORD** through a **pluggable
//! sink trait** (`AuditSink`) — capturing more of the access-decision context that a
//! compliance audit trail needs:
//!
//!   * **actor** — the authenticated subject (a WebID / agent IRI when known, else a Bearer
//!     token fingerprint, else `anonymous`),
//!   * **action** — read / write / query / update / graph-read / graph-write,
//!   * **resource** — the dataset / named-graph IRI the request touched (when the surface
//!     names one), else the request path,
//!   * **decision** — allow / deny, with the **policy basis** that produced it (the actual
//!     enforcement reason: the Bearer-auth gate, etc.),
//!   * **timestamp** — RFC-3339-ish UTC wall-clock, plus a monotonic `duration_us`,
//!   * a **request fingerprint** — the SAME FNV-1a construction the redaction / `audit-log`
//!     fingerprints use (`fingerprint`), so an operator can correlate this record with the
//!     `audit-log` trail and with redacted error logs.
//!
//! ## Opt-in, lean, zero-cost-when-off
//!
//! The whole module is gated behind the `access-audit` cargo feature **and** a runtime sink:
//! [`AppState`](crate::http::AppState) carries an `Option<Arc<dyn AuditSink>>` that is `None`
//! unless the operator configured one (`--access-audit <target>` / `SPARQ_ACCESS_AUDIT`).
//! With the feature OFF the module is not compiled and every call site is `#[cfg]`-stripped,
//! so a request pays exactly zero. With the feature ON but no sink configured, a single
//! `Option` check short-circuits before any record is built.
//!
//! ## Privacy boundary — STATED EXPLICITLY
//!
//! An audit trail exists **precisely to record WHO accessed WHAT and whether it was allowed**,
//! so — by design, and unlike the request log — this sink **DOES record identities and
//! resources**: the actor (WebID / agent IRI / token fingerprint) and the resource IRI are
//! first-class fields. That is the point of an audit trail and is the operator's deliberate,
//! opt-in choice.
//!
//! What it **does NOT** record is query **CONTENT**. The query / update text is recorded only
//! as its non-reversible `fingerprint` — never the raw SPARQL — because (per the #241
//! info-leak posture and the sq-toze.34 redaction work) a query body can itself carry PII (a
//! patient IRI in a `FILTER`, an email literal) or disclose loaded-data fragments. The sink
//! therefore does **not** double-log the content the redaction work just protected. The
//! boundary in one line: **identities + resources are logged (that is the audit trail);
//! content stays fingerprinted.**
