//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-0bxp) **Opt-in per-query access audit log** — CDMC CD-2 (access audit),
//! composes with ISO 27001 A.8.15 (logging) and the EU CRA logging expectations.
//!
//! The CDMC audit (#234) rated access-audit a **2** because the server emits only
//! AGGREGATE metrics (`GET /metrics`) — there is NO per-subject / per-query audit trail.
//! This module adds one: for every query / update / Graph-Store request the server emits a
//! single STRUCTURED `tracing` event under the dedicated `target: "sparq_server::audit"`,
//! carrying *who* asked, *what class* of operation, a *stable query fingerprint*, the
//! *access decision*, the *result size / status*, and the *duration*. Operators route that
//! target to whatever sink their compliance regime requires (a file, journald, an
//! OpenTelemetry collector, a SIEM) via the standard `RUST_LOG` / `EnvFilter` machinery the
//! `--verbose` request log already uses.
//!
//! ## Opt-in, lean, zero-overhead-when-off
//!
//! The whole module is gated behind the `audit-log` cargo feature **and** a runtime flag
//! ([`ServerConfig::audit_log`] / `--audit-log` / `SPARQ_AUDIT_LOG=1`). With the feature OFF
//! the module is not compiled and every call site is `#[cfg]`-stripped, so a request pays
//! exactly zero — no field is captured, no timer is read, no branch is taken. With the
//! feature ON but the runtime flag OFF, a single boolean check short-circuits before any
//! record is built. Only when both are on does the server assemble and emit a record.
//!
//! ## No-PII / no-info-leak posture (reuses the #241 lesson)
//!
//! This is a **server-side** log under the operator's control — it is NEVER written to the
//! HTTP response (that is the #241 information-leak contract: detail to the server log, a
//! generic class to the client). Critically it does **not** log the full query text by
//! default: the #241 fix established that raw SPARQL can disclose loaded-data fragments and
//! caller input, and a query body can itself carry PII (a patient IRI, an email in a
//! `FILTER`). Instead the record carries a **stable non-reversible fingerprint** (a FNV-1a
//! hash of the normalised query text, hex-encoded) plus the operation class — enough to
//! correlate repeated identical queries and spot anomalous access patterns without ever
//! persisting the query content. The requester identity is likewise a fingerprint of the
//! authenticated Bearer token, never the secret itself.
