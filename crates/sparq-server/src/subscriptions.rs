//! SEPA-style SPARQL subscriptions over WebSocket (T23).
//!
//! Spec lineage: the **SEPA** W3C member submission ("SPARQL 1.1 Subscribe Language",
//! <https://www.w3.org/submissions/2018/SUBM-sparql11-subscribe-20181016/>) — a client
//! registers a SELECT query and is notified with **added/removed bindings diffs**
//! whenever a committed update changes the query's result. We keep SEPA's notification
//! *shape* (both diffs are SPARQL JSON results objects) but speak plain JSON over a
//! plain WebSocket — no `sparql-se` URI scheme, no separate subscribe HTTP endpoint.
//! See `crates/sparq-server/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for the full protocol and divergences.
//!
//! # Architecture: re-evaluate + diff per committed update
//!
//! * **Commit hook** — [`crate::http::AppState::apply_update`] advances a
//!   `tokio::sync::watch` channel to the published generation number *after* the
//!   sequenced writer's group-commit ack. Every `/subscriptions` connection task holds
//!   a `watch::Receiver`.
//! * **Re-evaluation** — when the generation changes, the connection task re-runs each of
//!   its active SELECTs against a freshly pinned generation
//!   ([`crate::http::AppState::current`]) on the blocking pool (`spawn_blocking`), under
//!   the server's [`sparq_engine::QueryBudget`] (query timeout + `--max-results` row
//!   cap), then diffs against the stored previous result.
//! * **Diff** — each solution row is canonicalised to its SPARQL-JSON binding object
//!   (variables sorted by `serde_json`'s map ordering) and the serialised string is the
//!   row's identity key in a `HashMap<key, binding>`. Added = keys in the new result only;
//!   removed = keys in the old result only. Set semantics: duplicate rows collapse to one
//!   key (documented divergence — SELECT is a bag, the diff is over distinct bindings).
//! * **Coalescing (dirty-flag pattern)** — the `watch` channel stores only the latest
//!   generation, and `Receiver::changed()` resolves once when the seen value is stale, no
//!   matter how many commits produced it. If commits land *while* a re-evaluation is
//!   running, the generation advances again, so the loop's next `changed()` fires
//!   immediately and one more re-evaluation — against the latest snapshot — covers the
//!   whole burst. Notifications are therefore per *re-evaluation*, not per commit, and a
//!   client may observe several commits as a single combined diff. Because the generation
//!   is bumped after the swap, a snapshot taken after `changed()` resolves is always at
//!   least as new as the commit that woke us; an "early" snapshot only leads to a later
//!   empty diff, which is suppressed.
//! * **Limits** — per-connection cap (`--max-subscriptions-per-conn`, default 16) checked
//!   against the connection's own table; global cap (`--max-subscriptions`, default 256)
//!   via an atomic acquire/release counter with a panic-safe release on connection drop.
//!   An initial evaluation that overflows `--max-results` (or times out) *refuses* the
//!   subscription, mirroring the HTTP 413/503 semantics; a later re-evaluation failure
//!   terminates the subscription with an `error` message.
//!
//! Known limitation: the engine relabels blank nodes between evaluations, so a result row
//! containing a blank node can show up as a remove+add pair across commits even when it is
//! semantically unchanged.
