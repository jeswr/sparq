//! [OPUS-4.8] (sq-3dyje.12) OCC transaction concurrency stress tests — lost-update /
//! write-write interleaving under real `std::thread` contention, plus reader-under-writer
//! snapshot-isolation assertions.
//!
//! # Why std-thread stress and NOT loom (the honest applicability verdict)
//!
//! `loom` exhaustively permutes the interleavings of *hand-rolled* concurrency — atomics
//! (`AtomicUsize`, `compare_exchange`, `fetch_add`), `UnsafeCell`, and lock-free sequencing.
//! The OCC path here has **none** of that. `TransactionManager` guards ALL mutable shared
//! state — the committed `Arc<Graph>` generation, the version counter, the commit log, and
//! the prune watermarks — behind a single `std::sync::Mutex<State>` (`txn.rs`). Every entry
//! point (`begin_read`, `begin_write`, `commit`, `rollback`, `into_inner`) takes that one
//! lock, and `commit`'s read-check-publish is a single critical section. Snapshot isolation
//! is achieved with `Arc<Graph>` copy-on-write forks — again, no atomics, no `UnsafeCell`.
//!
//! With a coarse `Mutex`, there is no lock-free interleaving for loom to explore that the
//! `Mutex`'s own (already-verified, `std`) mutual exclusion does not already collapse: the
//! interesting question is not "does the lock work" but "does first-committer-wins reject a
//! lost update and never publish a torn overlay". That is a *logical* property of the commit
//! algorithm best exercised by real threads racing the `Mutex` under barrier-forced
//! contention — which is what this file does. Adding a `loom` dev-dep here would be
//! cargo-culting: it would model the `Mutex` (which loom supports) but exercise no synchro-
//! nization this crate actually authored.
//!
//! **Verdict: loom NOT applicable — coarse `Mutex` locking; std-thread stress is the tier.**
//! (If the OCC path is ever rewritten to hand-rolled atomics / a lock-free commit slot, THAT
//! change should file a follow-up loom bead naming the specific atomic interleaving.)
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Every race is forced with a `std::sync::Barrier` (all racers reach the commit point before
//! any of them proceeds) — no `sleep`, no wall-clock timing. Outcomes are asserted as
//! *invariants* (exactly-one-winner on a conflicting race; count-exact on a disjoint race;
//! snapshot-immunity for a reader) rather than as a fixed winner, because which thread wins
//! the `Mutex` is legitimately non-deterministic — but the invariant holds every time. Each
//! race is repeated `ITERS` times to shake orderings.
//!
//! Only compiled under the opt-in `txn` feature.
