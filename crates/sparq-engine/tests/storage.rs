//! [SONNET-4.6] sq-6vshe.9 — storage integration-test harness.
//! Consolidates compressed-build, dict, persistence, fork, and flat-read tests
//! into a single link unit.
//!
//! Integration-test crate roots resolve `mod foo;` relative to `tests/`, not
//! relative to a subdirectory, so explicit `#[path]` attributes are required.
