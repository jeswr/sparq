//! Bounded-memory assertion for streaming SERVICE result consumption. [FABLE-5]
//! (bead sq-my8wd.4)
//!
//! The engine must not materialise a remote SERVICE relation as owned terms before
//! the join: the pre-sq-my8wd.4 path held the response body PLUS a whole-document
//! JSON DOM PLUS a term-level copy of every row, so a large/adversarial remote result
//! amplified into a multiple of its own wire size. The streaming path interns each
//! row to compact ids as it is parsed, so the only response-scale state is the
//! (finite, transport-capped) body and the id-level relation the join itself needs.
//!
//! This test runs the PRODUCTION path — the real ureq `HttpTransport` against a
//! loopback endpoint — over a large, duplicate-heavy remote result and asserts, with
//! a thread-local byte-counting allocator, that the query thread's peak
//! live-allocation delta stays within a small multiple of the response body. The
//! multiplier is deliberately generous: the assertion pins the SHAPE of the bound
//! (O(body), not O(parsed DOM + term relation)), not a tuned number — the old
//! collect-everything path exceeds it by construction.
//!
//! The allocator lives HERE (an integration-test crate) because the engine crate
//! itself is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and a `GlobalAlloc` impl requires `unsafe`.
//! Counters are THREAD-LOCAL, so the server thread's allocations (serving the body)
//! and any parallel sibling test never pollute the measurement, and the measurement
//! is deterministic (no timing involved).
//!
//! Built only when the `service` feature is on:
//!   cargo test -p sparq-engine --features service --test service_stream_bounded
