//! [OPUS-4.8] Engine-level regression for the SPARQL parse-depth bound
//! (bead sq-1ukn, cert gap ASVS-G4 / ASVS V5.5.2; threat-model boundary B2,
//! T-PARSE-DoS).
//!
//! `spargebra` is a `peg` recursive-descent parser: each level of `{ }` / `( )` /
//! `[ ]` / `<<( )>>` syntactic nesting (group graph patterns, sub-SELECTs,
//! bracketed/unary expressions, property paths, RDF collections, blank-node
//! property lists, RDF-1.2 triple terms) maps onto native call-stack frames. The
//! vendored crate already caps that recursion (`MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH`, bead
//! sq-v5dg) and `vendor/spargebra/tests/recursion_depth.rs` proves the cap fires
//! at the `SparqlParser` layer. THIS file pins the same guarantee at the seam the
//! cert gap actually names — `sparq_engine::PreparedQuery::parse`, through which
//! every string query entry point (`query` / `ask` / `count` / `construct` / …)
//! funnels — and at the concrete attack envelope the bead calls out: a request
//! body filled to the server's default `--max-body-bytes` cap (1 MiB, see
//! `sparq_server::http` `ServerConfig::default`). Without the depth bound, that
//! body of nested delimiters would deep-recurse the parser until the native stack
//! overflows and ABORTS the process — an unauthenticated DoS. With it, the parse
//! returns a clean `Err` and the body cap is the only thing standing between an
//! attacker and the parser.
//!
//! Each case parses on a deliberately small 2 MiB thread stack — the size of a
//! tokio worker / blocking-pool thread, where the server actually parses (NOT the
//! larger main-thread `ulimit -s`). A stack overflow there aborts the whole test
//! process (SIGABRT), so reaching the `join()` at all is itself part of the
//! assertion: the parser must have RETURNED, not recursed to death.
