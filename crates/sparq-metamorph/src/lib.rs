//! Metamorphic + differential **logic-bug harness for SPARQL engines** — TLP and NoREC
//! re-derived for SPARQL's three-valued effective-boolean-value semantics, a
//! differential oracle over `sparq-difftest`, a seeded deterministic case generator,
//! SPARQL-protocol drivers, and the found-bug ledger format.
//!
//! [FABLE-5] Bead `sq-gum8.6` (epic `sq-gum8`, paper P2a → draft bead `sq-gum8.7`).
//! Research gap this machinery targets: dedicated logic-bug testing exists for SQL
//! (SQLancer: TLP, NoREC, PQS), Datalog (queryFuzz, DLSmith), and graph query languages
//! (GDsmith, Gamera for Cypher/Gremlin), but **not** for SPARQL engines — the closest
//! prior work (SparqLog, 2023) reported wrong results incidentally while comparing a
//! translation pipeline, not via a dedicated metamorphic oracle. The SPARQL-specific
//! re-derivation is genuinely different from the SQL original because SPARQL's third
//! truth state is an evaluation *error*, not a `NULL` value — see [`tlp`] for the full
//! case analysis (the paper's core claim).
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! * [`tlp`] — Ternary Logic Partitioning under SPARQL three-valued EBV semantics
//!   (`FILTER(c)` / `FILTER(!c)` / the reified error branch).
//! * [`norec`] — the non-optimizable-rewrite cardinality oracle (predicate moved to
//!   projection position).
//! * [`differential`] — cross-engine comparison, reusing `sparq-difftest`'s
//!   engine-independent comparators as a dependency (that crate is not modified here).
//!   Also hosts the `ORDER BY` differential mode.
//! * [`distinct`] — the `DISTINCT` TLP variant: the same partition recombined under
//!   **set** semantics (bead `sq-gum8.12`).
//! * [`aggregate`] — aggregate-aware partitioning: `COUNT`/`SUM` recombined over the
//!   three branches under SPARQL's aggregate **error** semantics (bead `sq-gum8.12`).
//! * [`generate`] — seeded, wall-clock-free, reproducible query/data generation.
//! * [`engine`] — the engine-under-test trait, the in-process sparq driver, and the
//!   deliberately-injected wrong-result mutant the self-tests must flag.
//! * [`harness`] — the seeded CI driver window (bead `sq-3dyje.9`): generated cases →
//!   TLP + NoREC verdicts, every verdict counted, fail-closed, deterministic repro on
//!   failure. Entry point of the `metamorph-driver` binary and the nightly
//!   `metamorph.yml` lane.
//! * [`ledger`] — the found-bug record format (upstream issue link + confirmation
//!   status REQUIRED per entry).
//! * `driver` (cargo feature `protocol-drivers`, off by default) — HTTP drivers for
//!   external engines over the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol. The bug-hunting campaign runs
//!   OFF-CI against live endpoints; CI runs only network-free self-tests.
//!
//! # Verdict discipline (fail-closed)
//!
//! Every oracle returns a [`Verdict`] that strictly separates **wrong-result**
//! violations from **engine failures** (see [`verdict`]); an engine error is never
//! silently passed and never counted as a logic bug. The oracle self-tests include a
//! mutation check: a wrapper that silently removes a row from filtered results
//! ([`engine::FilterDropsRow`]) must be flagged by TLP, NoREC, the `DISTINCT` and
//! aggregate variants, *and* both differential modes — a suite that cannot flag its own
//! seeded bug proves nothing. Each `sq-gum8.12` extension additionally carries a mutant
//! aimed at the law it introduces (an off-by-one aggregate cell, an aggregate silently
//! unbound, a reversed result order), since a mutant that only ever perturbs
//! *cardinality* would leave the new laws vacuously green.
//!
//! # Honest scope
//!
//! This crate is the *instrument*, not the campaign: bug counts belong to the (off-CI)
//! campaign and enter the [`ledger`] only with an upstream issue link and a
//! developer-confirmation status. The oracles' scope preconditions (deterministic
//! predicates, no `EXISTS`, plain `SELECT` at the oracle level, no blank-node
//! projection cross-engine) are documented in the respective modules and enforced by
//! the generator's grammar.
//!
//! Each oracle's scope is a statement about which **recombination law** was derived, not
//! about what is testable: `sq-gum8.12` widens the surface with three variants
//! ([`distinct`], [`aggregate`], [`differential::check_differential_ordered`]), each with
//! its own derivation and its own mutation self-test. `EXISTS` is the one exclusion that
//! is *not* a missing derivation — its substitution semantics is a known SPARQL 1.1
//! defect under revision for SPARQL 1.2, so a violation involving it would measure the
//! standard rather than an engine. It stays excluded from every oracle until SPARQL 1.2
//! settles it.
