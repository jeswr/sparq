//! **Aggregate-aware partitioning: `COUNT`/`SUM` recombined over the three TLP
//! branches.** [OPUS-5] sq-gum8.12
//!
//! TLP for SQL has aggregate variants (Rigger & Su, OOPSLA 2020 §3.3): partition the
//! table, aggregate each partition, and recombine — `COUNT` and `SUM` by addition. The
//! *partitioning* transfers to SPARQL unchanged (it is the same three-branch trichotomy
//! [`crate::tlp`] derives), but the *recombination* does not: SQL aggregates ignore
//! `NULL`s, while a SPARQL aggregate has to answer for an evaluation **error**, and the
//! spec's answer is neither "ignore it" nor "fail the query". This module re-derives the
//! law for SPARQL, in a form that is **invariant** under the one place where engines and
//! readings of the spec legitimately differ.
//!
//! # Setup
//!
//! With no `GROUP BY`, a query with an aggregate treats the whole solution bag as a
//! single group and returns exactly **one** solution (SPARQL 1.1 §18.5.1 `Group`, the
//! implicit single-group case; §18.5.1.1 also fixes the empty-group values —
//! `Count({}) = 0`, `Sum({}) = 0`). So each of the four queries below returns one row
//! whose aggregate cell is either **bound** or **unbound**; [`check_tlp_aggregate`]
//! treats any other row count as a violation, since the spec leaves no latitude there.
//!
//! Let `agg` be the aggregate under test and `Ω = Ω_t ⊎ Ω_f ⊎ Ω_e` the trichotomy of
//! [`crate::tlp`] (branch filters built by the shared `tlp::branch_filters`).
//!
//! # The three per-row outcomes, and why they recombine
//!
//! For each solution `μ` in the group, the aggregated expression `e` evaluates to a
//! value, to **unbound**, or to an **error**. SPARQL treats them differently, and — the
//! load-bearing point — it treats each of them **row-locally**:
//!
//! * *value* — contributes to the fold.
//! * *unbound* — the row is **removed** from the aggregation ("aggregate over the bound
//!   values": `SUM(?x)` over a column that is unbound on some rows still sums the rows
//!   that do have a value, rather than collapsing). Removal is per row.
//! * *error* — this is where readings differ. Under the **fatal** reading an erroring
//!   member makes the *whole* aggregate a type error, and an aggregate that errors leaves
//!   its projected variable **unbound** for that row (an error in an `Extend` expression
//!   leaves the variable unbound while keeping the solution, §18.5). Under the **drop**
//!   reading erroring members are removed from the multiset like unbound ones and the
//!   aggregate stays bound. sparq is not uniform across the two — `SUM` is fatal-on-error
//!   while `COUNT` drops the erroring member — and that is *measured*, not assumed:
//!   `tests/oracle_self_tests.rs` pins both behaviours against the real engine. (sparq's
//!   evaluator attributes its `SUM` choice to the W3C `agg-err-01` test; that attribution
//!   is quoted from `crates/sparq-engine/src/exec.rs` and was not independently
//!   re-derived here — which is exactly why the law below is written to be indifferent
//!   to which reading an engine under test picked.)
//!
//! Either way the *error status* of a group is a row-local predicate lifted by an
//! **`OR` over the group's rows** (fatal reading: "some row errored") or is identically
//! false (drop reading). Both distribute over a partition, which is what lets the
//! relation below be stated without committing to one reading:
//!
//! ```text
//! (1)  cell(base) is unbound   ⟺   cell of SOME branch is unbound
//! (2)  all four cells bound    ⇒   cell(base) = cell(t) + cell(f) + cell(e)
//! ```
//!
//! *Why (1).* Under the fatal reading, the offending row lies in exactly one branch
//! (the trichotomy is a partition), so base errors iff that branch errors; under the drop
//! reading both sides are always false. *Why (2).* `Count` and `Sum` are folds of a
//! commutative, associative operation with an identity over the (row-locally filtered)
//! member multiset, and the member multisets of the branches partition the base's, so
//! the folds add. An **empty** branch contributes the identity: `Count({}) = 0` and
//! `Sum({}) = 0` (§18.5.1.1) — not unbound — which is exactly what makes (2) hold when
//! a partition is empty. (`MIN`/`MAX` over an empty group *are* unbound, and `AVG` is
//! not additive at all; both are therefore out of scope here — see below.)
//!
//! # The exactness precondition (why `SumInteger`, not `Sum`)
//!
//! (2) is an *exact* equation, so the fold must be exact. SPARQL `SUM` uses XPath
//! numeric addition with type promotion: over `xsd:integer` (and over `xsd:decimal`) it
//! is exact and associative, but as soon as one member promotes the fold to
//! `xsd:double`, floating-point addition is **no longer associative** and the base sum
//! may legitimately differ from the sum of the branch sums in the last bits — a false
//! violation. [`PartitionedAggregate::SumInteger`] therefore carries the precondition
//! that the aggregated expression yields `xsd:integer`, unbound, or an error on every
//! solution, and the checker enforces it: a bound cell that is not an `xsd:integer`
//! literal is reported as a [`crate::verdict::FailureKind::Harness`] failure — never as
//! a wrong-result claim. Integer-valued *error fuel* is easy to write inside the
//! precondition (`SUM(?w + 1)` errors on an unbound `?w`; a `xsd:integer(?v)` cast
//! errors on a non-castable term), so the error law (1) stays exercised.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! * In scope: `COUNT(*)`, `COUNT(e)`, `SUM(e)` with `e` integer-valued (above).
//! * Out of scope: `AVG` (not additive — recombining it needs the paired counts and
//!   reintroduces division rounding), `MIN`/`MAX` (recombinable in principle, but their
//!   empty-group value is *unbound*, which collides with the error-status law (1) and
//!   would make an empty branch indistinguishable from an errored one),
//!   `GROUP_CONCAT`/`SAMPLE` (order/choice are implementation-defined), `GROUP BY` (the
//!   law generalises per group, but comparing grouped results needs a key-wise join and
//!   is a separate oracle), and `DISTINCT` inside the aggregate (`SUM(DISTINCT ?x)` is
//!   *not* additive over a partition: a value occurring in two branches is counted twice
//!   by the branch sums and once by the base).
//! * Preconditions 1, 2 and 4 of [`crate::tlp`] apply unchanged. In particular `EXISTS`
//!   stays excluded — pending the SPARQL 1.2 resolution of its substitution semantics —
//!   in `c` *and* in the aggregated expression.
