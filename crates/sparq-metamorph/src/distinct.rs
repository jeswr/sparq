//! **TLP under SET semantics: the `DISTINCT` partition variant.** [OPUS-5] sq-gum8.12
//!
//! The shipped [`crate::tlp`] oracle recombines the three partitions with **multiset**
//! union, which is why its scope preconditions exclude `DISTINCT`/`REDUCED`. That
//! exclusion is a statement about the *recombination law*, not about testability:
//! `DISTINCT` is perfectly partitionable once the law is re-derived, and the derivation
//! below shows the union becomes a **set** union — with a *strictly stronger*
//! (multiset) law recoverable in the one case where the partitions are provably
//! disjoint.
//!
//! # Derivation
//!
//! Write `Ω = eval(P)` for the solution **bag** of the group graph pattern, and split it
//! on the effective boolean value of the deterministic filter expression `c`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Ω  =  Ω_t ⊎ Ω_f ⊎ Ω_e ,    Ω_x = { μ ∈ Ω | ebv(c, μ) = x }
//! ```
//!
//! This is the same trichotomy [`crate::tlp`] derives (SPARQL 1.1 §17.2.2; total and
//! exclusive because `ebv(c, μ)` is a function of `μ` alone), and the three branch
//! queries append exactly the same three `FILTER` clauses (the shared
//! `tlp::branch_filters` constructor, so the variants cannot drift apart).
//!
//! Let `π_V` be projection onto the variable list `V` and `D` be `Distinct` (SPARQL 1.1
//! §18.5: `Distinct(Ψ)` keeps one copy of each solution mapping — i.e. it maps a bag to
//! its **support set**). Two facts do the work:
//!
//! * `π_V` is applied **per solution mapping**, so it is a bag homomorphism:
//!   `π_V(A ⊎ B) = π_V(A) ⊎ π_V(B)`.
//! * `supp(A ⊎ B) = supp(A) ∪ supp(B)` — the support of a multiset union is the *set*
//!   union of the supports.
//!
//! Composing them:
//!
//! ```text
//! D(π_V(Ω))  =  D(π_V(Ω_t))  ∪  D(π_V(Ω_f))  ∪  D(π_V(Ω_e))
//! ```
//!
//! The union is `∪`, **not** `⊎`, and the difference is not cosmetic: `D` destroys
//! multiset additivity exactly when two solutions in *different* branches project to the
//! same row. Then `|D(π(Ω))| < |D(π(Ω_t))| + |D(π(Ω_f))| + |D(π(Ω_e))|`, so a naive
//! reuse of the multiset law would manufacture a "violation" on a correct engine.
//! `tests/oracle_self_tests.rs` pins exactly that witness against the real engine (the
//! test named `distinct_partitions_recombine_by_set_union_not_multiset_union`), so the
//! choice of `∪` is checked rather than asserted.
//!
//! # The `SELECT DISTINCT *` strengthening (disjointness)
//!
//! With `V` = all in-scope variables (`SELECT DISTINCT *`), `π_V` is the identity and the
//! three sets are **pairwise disjoint**: a solution mapping `μ` in two of them would need
//! `ebv(c, μ)` to take two of {true, false, error} at once, contradicting the trichotomy.
//! A disjoint set union *is* a multiset union, so in that case the stronger law
//!
//! ```text
//! D(Ω)  =  D(Ω_t) ⊎ D(Ω_f) ⊎ D(Ω_e)      (cardinalities add)
//! ```
//!
//! also holds, and [`check_tlp_distinct`] checks it in addition to the set law whenever
//! the projection is `*`. (`FILTER` contributes no bindings and does not change the
//! in-scope variables — §18.2.1 — so all four queries project the same variables and
//! `DISTINCT` compares like-shaped solutions.)
//!
//! # What this widens
//!
//! The base [`crate::tlp`] oracle never exercises an engine's duplicate-elimination
//! path. This variant runs it in four different query shapes and cross-checks that
//! `Distinct` **commutes with the partition** — the surface where a hash-dedup bug
//! (over-eager collapse of two term-distinct rows, a lost row on a hash collision,
//! dedup applied before rather than after a projection) shows up as a wrong result with
//! nothing crashing.
//!
//! # Comparator note (a sensitivity limit, not a soundness hole)
//!
//! SPARQL `Distinct` is defined by **RDF term** equality of solution mappings, whereas
//! the harness keys rows with [`sparq_difftest::canonical_key`], which is *value*
//! canonical (`"01"^^xsd:integer` and `"1"^^xsd:integer` share a key). The coarser key
//! can only merge rows the engine kept apart, so equal exact result sets always have
//! equal key images: the check can **mask** a divergence (a false pass) but can never
//! manufacture one (a false violation). Same regime as the shipped oracles — see
//! [`crate::differential`].
//!
//! # Scope preconditions
//!
//! Preconditions 1, 2 and 4 of [`crate::tlp`] apply unchanged (deterministic `c`, no
//! `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS`, top-level filter placement). Precondition 3 is *relaxed* to
//! allow `DISTINCT` and a projection list, and no further: still no `REDUCED` (it is
//! explicitly implementation-defined how many duplicates survive, §18.5, so no law
//! holds), and still no `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`/`OFFSET` (slicing does not commute with
//! partitioning). `V` must be a subset of the in-scope variables of `P`.
//!
//! `EXISTS` stays excluded here for the same reason as in [`crate::tlp`]: its
//! substitution semantics is a known SPARQL 1.1 defect under revision for SPARQL 1.2, so
//! a "violation" involving it would measure the standard, not the engine. Revisit when
//! SPARQL 1.2 settles it — not before.
