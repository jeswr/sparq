//! **Cross-engine differential oracle** — the same query and data on two or more
//! engines, results compared with sparq-difftest's engine-independent comparators.
//! [FABLE-5] sq-gum8.6
//!
//! Unlike TLP/NoREC (which need only one engine's *internal* consistency), the
//! differential oracle needs an agreement standard across engines. That standard is
//! deliberately **not** any engine's own value code: results are compared through
//! [`sparq_difftest`]'s independent normalisation (see that crate's load-bearing
//! independence constraint), so a value bug shared by harness and engine cannot cancel.
//!
//! # Comparison semantics
//!
//! * `SELECT` results: **multiset equality** over value-canonical solution keys
//!   ([`sparq_difftest::multiset_equal`]) — order-insensitive, duplicate-preserving.
//!   Queries with `ORDER BY` are out of scope for [`check_differential`]; the ordered
//!   mode is [`check_differential_ordered`] (see *ORDER BY differential mode* below).
//! * `ASK` results: boolean equality.
//! * Shape mismatch (one engine answers a `SELECT`, another a boolean): classified as
//!   [`FailureKind::InvalidResults`] — a protocol/driver problem to triage, **not** a
//!   wrong-result claim (fail-closed).
//!
//! # Scope limits (documented, generator-enforced)
//!
//! * **Blank nodes**: sparq-difftest compares blank nodes by engine-local label, which
//!   is only meaningful within one engine (cross-engine label agreement is not required
//!   by SPARQL). The query/data generator therefore emits no blank nodes; cross-engine
//!   blank-node isomorphism is a separate difftest DAG node (bead `sq-qcnn.7`).
//! * **Implementation-defined behaviour**: engines may legitimately differ where the
//!   spec leaves latitude (extended-datatype comparisons, some canonical lexical
//!   choices — the value-canonical keying absorbs the known lexical variance). A
//!   reported divergence is a *candidate* bug; campaign triage attributes it to an
//!   engine (or to spec latitude) before it enters the found-bug ledger with an
//!   upstream issue link.
//!
//! # `ORDER BY` differential mode [OPUS-5] sq-gum8.12
//!
//! [`check_differential`] deliberately throws the row order away, so it cannot see an
//! ordering bug at all: an engine that sorts wrongly returns the same *bag* and passes.
//! [`check_differential_ordered`] closes that gap — and the reason it is a separate
//! entry point rather than "compare the sequences" is that **plain sequence equality is
//! not a sound oracle for `ORDER BY`**.
//!
//! SPARQL's `ORDER BY` is only a *partial* specification of the result sequence (SPARQL
//! 1.1 §15.1 `ORDER BY`, algebra §18.5 `OrderBy`): solutions that compare equal on every
//! sort condition may be returned in **any** relative order, and two conforming engines
//! may differ there. The sound relation is therefore equality **up to permutation within
//! each sort-key equivalence class**, which is exactly
//! [`sparq_difftest::order_by_equal`]: both sequences are cut into maximal runs of
//! consecutive rows sharing the sort key, the runs must line up in order and by key, and
//! each pair of corresponding runs must be multiset-equal. Cross-run reordering — a
//! genuine order bug — is caught; within-run permutation — spec-permitted latitude — is
//! not reported. Both halves of that statement are pinned by the self-tests, because an
//! order oracle that flags legal latitude is worse than none.
//!
//! ## Scope preconditions (ordered mode)
//!
//! 1. **The sort variables must be pairwise comparable across the whole result.** §15.1
//!    fixes an order *between* term kinds (unbound < blank nodes < IRIs < literals) and,
//!    within literals, only for the datatypes the operator mapping orders; for anything
//!    else the ordering "is implementation-defined" while still being a total order. A
//!    mixed-datatype sort column (say integers next to language-tagged strings) therefore
//!    lets two conforming engines disagree, and a "violation" would measure spec latitude
//!    rather than an engine bug. Sort on a single-datatype (or unbound) column.
//! 2. **`sort_vars` must be the query's actual `ORDER BY` variable list, in order.** The
//!    comparator partitions runs by exactly these variables; passing fewer merges runs
//!    (weaker but still sound), passing *more* or different ones splits runs that the
//!    engine was free to order either way and can manufacture a false violation.
//!    [`ordered_query`] builds the query and returns the list, so the two cannot drift.
//! 3. Sort *conditions* are restricted to bare variables (no `ORDER BY DESC(…)` or
//!    expression conditions): the comparator keys runs by variable value, so an
//!    expression condition has no key to partition by. Ascending order is the default
//!    (§15.1) and the run partition is direction-agnostic anyway — it only cares which
//!    rows tie.
//!
//! Note the run-key is [`sparq_difftest::canonical_key`], which distinguishes datatypes:
//! `"1"^^xsd:integer` and `"1.0"^^xsd:decimal` are `=`-equal (so they may tie under
//! `ORDER BY`) yet key apart, splitting a legitimate tie run. Precondition 1 rules that
//! case out; it is the same restriction, seen from the comparator side.
