//! Oracle verdict types — **wrong-result strictly distinguished from engine-error**.
//! [FABLE-5] sq-gum8.6
//!
//! Every oracle in this crate returns a [`Verdict`] with exactly three top-level states:
//!
//! * [`Verdict::Pass`] — every query the oracle needed evaluated successfully **and** the
//!   metamorphic/differential relation held on this input. `Pass` is only ever constructed
//!   *after* an explicit comparison succeeds; there is no default-pass path.
//! * [`Verdict::Violation`] — every query evaluated successfully but the relation is
//!   **broken**: a wrong-result **logic-bug signal** (the class SQLancer calls a logic bug:
//!   silently incorrect results, the worst failure mode because nothing crashes).
//! * [`Verdict::EngineFailure`] — some query did **not** evaluate (rejected, transport
//!   error, unparseable results, harness precondition unmet). This is *fail-closed*: an
//!   engine error is never reported as `Pass` (it would mask a crash bug) and never as
//!   `Violation` (it is not evidence of a wrong result). Campaign triage decides whether a
//!   given failure is itself ledger-worthy (an internal error on a valid query is a bug of
//!   the [`crate::ledger::BugClass::EngineError`] class — distinct from a wrong result).
