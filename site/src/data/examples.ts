// [OPUS-4.8] sq-vw3ax.6 — the /examples gallery model: the curated "show me it working"
// set, derived from the single FLAGSHIPS source (data/surfaces.ts) plus the live workbench.
//
// /examples is the curated "show me it working" gallery (research/website-redesign.md §4):
// a 2-col grid of LARGE demo cards = the 3 flagships (zk-car-hire, mpc-100k, solid-pairs) +
// a "Live SPARQL workbench" card. Each card carries a one-line OUTCOME (what you walk away
// having proven), a tier badge, and an [Open demo] CTA. The /showcase/<slug> pages are the
// detail targets (rebuilt demo-first); the workbench card targets /app (sq-4hiqe: the /try
// REPL was removed — /app is the single workbench).
//
// Keeping the three flagship items derived from FLAGSHIPS (rather than re-listed) means a
// re-word of a flagship's title/blurb/tier in surfaces.ts flows straight into this gallery, the
// Home "See it work" row, and Cmd-K together — no second source to drift.
