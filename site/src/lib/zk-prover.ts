// [OPUS-4.8] sq-13rg — REAL in-browser zero-knowledge proving for the car-hire
// age-gate, via Noir + Barretenberg UltraHonk compiled to WASM.
//
// This is NOT a simulation. The age-gate sub-proof of the car-hire flagship runs
// the genuine sparq ZK circuit `zk/compose/filter_int_d2` (compiled with
// `nargo 1.0.0-beta.21` to the ACIR JSON shipped at `/zk/filter_int_d2.json`) and
// proves it with `@aztec/bb.js` (UltraHonk, the same prover the native crate drives
// over its `bb` subprocess) entirely in your tab:
//
//   private witness: the holder's exact age (the decimal digits)
//   public inputs:   challenge, operand_enc (the committed term anchor), op (≥),
//                    bound (25), expected (true)  — the age itself is NEVER public.
//
// The circuit (`sparq_zk_compose_core::filter_int`) rebuilds the canonical
// `"<digits>"^^xsd:integer` N-Triples token in-circuit, hashes it (blake3 blackbox),
// and asserts `h2(LITERAL, hs) == operand_enc` — binding the hidden value to the
// committed credential — then asserts the comparison verdict. A false claim
// (e.g. age 24 proving "≥ 25 = true") is UNSATISFIABLE: the witness solve fails, so
// no proof can be produced. That is the soundness the demo demonstrates live.
//
// HONESTY: the *cryptographic mechanics* here are real and run in your browser. The
// broader sparq ZK estate is research-grade, internally reviewed only, and NOT
// externally audited — see the page's honesty panel and SECURITY.md. Do not treat a
// proof produced here as production-trustworthy.
//
// bb.js + noir_js are lazy-loaded via dynamic import (client-only) so the ~MB WASM
// never enters the main page bundle, mirroring the lean-wasm REPL loader.

/** Field encodings of `"<age>"^^xsd:integer`, precomputed natively via
 *  `sparq_zk_compose::build::encode_int_literal` (the SAME encoder the scan proof
 *  uses for the operand column). Each is the `operand_enc` public input that binds
 *  the hidden age to the committed credential.
 *
 *  DRIFT GUARD (sq-1s2.4): these values are pinned against the native encoder by
 *  `crates/sparq-zk-compose/tests/site_age_enc_drift.rs`. If a circuit / encoder bump
 *  changes the term encoding, that test fails RED and prints the regenerated hex to
 *  paste here — do NOT let these go stale, or the live in-browser age-gate becomes
 *  unsatisfiable (the witness solve fails). */
