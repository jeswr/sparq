# [OPUS-4.8] Trust promotion: decide if a quarantined (trust:untrusted) item may be promoted.
"""promote.py — revision-bound 👍 promotion of third-party content.

GitHub Actions has NO reaction event, so a cron polls quarantined issues and calls this. An item is
promoted iff a MAINTAINER (write/maintain/admin) added a 👍 reaction **after** the item's last edit —
so editing the body after approval invalidates it (the review's S3 TOCTOU fix). Reactions before the
last edit, or from non-maintainers, do not promote.

Pure `should_promote()` is unit-tested; the cron supplies reactions + updated_at + the maintainer set.
